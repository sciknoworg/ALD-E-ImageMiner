a	The stacked area chart illustrates the solar spectrum across different materials (c-Si, PSC, DSSC, a-Si) with distinct peaks at various wavelengths.
b	The 3D area chart depicts the layers of a solar cell system, including contacts, solar cell, and UC layer.
c	The multiple line chart shows the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell under different thickness conditions (Reference, 30 nm, 45 nm, 60 nm).
