a	The figure illustrates different methods of material synthesis: doping, homogenous mixing, and nanolaminates. Each method is represented by a sequence of symbols indicating the presence of precursors A, B, co-reactant, and purging.
b	The figure shows a color-coded representation of the materials involved in the synthesis process: blue for precursor A, red for precursor B, green for the co-reactant, and black for purging.
