a	The image illustrates a process involving multiple steps labeled as 'Metal A pulse', 'O3 pulse', 'Dopant pulse', and another 'O3 pulse'. Each step shows a sequence of molecular interactions and the formation of a supercycle through repeated cycles.
b	The image depicts a progression of molecular structures through different stages labeled as 'Metal A pulse', 'O3 pulse', 'Dopant pulse', and another 'O3 pulse'. It also shows the formation of a supercycle by repeating these steps multiple times.
c	The image illustrates the formation of a supercycle through repeated cycles of molecular interactions labeled as 'Metal A pulse', 'O3 pulse', 'Dopant pulse', and another 'O3 pulse'. The final stages show the completion of the supercycle at different repetition levels (X=1, X=3, X=5).
