a	The graph shows the relationship between deposition temperature (T<sub>dep</sub>) and GPC (Å/cycle). As the temperature increases, GPC decreases.
b	The graph illustrates the impact of pulse length on GPC (Å/cycle). Longer pulse lengths generally result in higher GPC values.
c	The line chart depicts the relationship between the number of cycles and thickness (nm). There is a linear increase in thickness with more cycles.
