The chart illustrates the relationship between deposition temperature and growth per cycle under different plasma conditions. At lower temperatures, the growth rate is higher, but it decreases as temperature increases. The blue line represents O₂ Plasma at 170 mTorr and 15 mTorr, while the red line represents Thermal (H₂O) at the same pressures.
