The chart illustrates the resistivity of materials measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry and 4-point probe techniques as a function of hydrogen plasma exposure time. Both methods show a decreasing trend in resistivity with increasing exposure time, with spectroscopic ellipsometry generally yielding lower resistivity values.
