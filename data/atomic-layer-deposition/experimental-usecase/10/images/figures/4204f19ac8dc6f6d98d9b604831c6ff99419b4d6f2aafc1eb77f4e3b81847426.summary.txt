The chart illustrates the growth per cycle (Ã…/cycle) of various titanium alkoxides under plasma ALD and thermal ALD conditions at different deposition temperatures. The growth rates for all compounds generally increase slightly with temperature, except for Ti(Cp*)(OMe)_3 which shows a slight decrease.
