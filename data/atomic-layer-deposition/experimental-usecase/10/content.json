        "text": "Plasma- assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an energy- enhanced method for the synthesis of ultra- thin films with Å- level resolution in which a plasma is employed during one step of the cyclic deposition process. The use of plasma species as reactants allows for more freedom in processing conditions and for a wider range of material properties compared with the conventional thermally- driven ALD method. Due to the continuous miniaturization in the microelectronics industry and the increasing relevance of ultra- thin films in many other applications, the deposition method has rapidly gained popularity in recent years, as is apparent from the increased number of articles published on the topic and plasma- assisted ALD reactors installed. To address the main differences between plasma- assisted ALD and thermal ALD, some basic aspects related to processing plasmas are presented in this review article. The plasma species and their role in the surface chemistry are addressed and different equipment configurations, including radical- enhanced ALD, direct plasma ALD, and remote plasma ALD, are described. The benefits and challenges provided by the use of a plasma step are presented and it is shown that the use of a plasma leads to a wider choice in material properties, substrate temperature, choice of precursors, and processing conditions, but that the processing can also be compromised by reduced film conformality and plasma damage. Finally, several reported emerging applications of plasma- assisted ALD are reviewed. It is expected that the merits offered by plasma- assisted ALD will further increase the interest of equipment manufacturers for developing industrial- scale deposition configurations such that the method will find its use in several manufacturing applications. © 2011 American Vacuum Society.

        "text": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor- phase deposition technique in which ultra- thin films are typically synthesized sub- monolayer by sub- monolayer by repeating two subsequently executed half- cycles.1- 10 See Fig. 1 for a schematic illustration of an ALD cycle. ALD offers atomic layer precision of the growth, because the reaction of the species dosed during the two half- cycles is self- limiting. As a consequence, when sufficient precursor and reactant species are dosed, the ALD film growth is not flux- dependent, as is the case with deposition techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD). The growth rate with respect to ALD is expressed as the growth per cycle (GPC), which is typically in the range of 0.05- 0.1 nm per cycle. In order to ensure that only ALD surface reactions take place and not CVD- like reactions, which can appear when precursor and reactant are present in the reactor at the same time, a purge step is executed after each half- cycle to remove the residual precursor or reactant species. The total duration of a cycle is the sum of the precursor dosing time, the precursor purge time, the reactant dose time and the reactant purge time. Consequently, the duration of one cycle cannot only be shortened by optimizing the dosing times, but also by optimizing the purge times. During ALD, the reactant is typically a gas, such as  $\\mathrm{O}_2$ , or a vapor, such as  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ , and the surface reactions are thermally- driven by slightly elevated substrate temperatures (typically 150- 350  ${}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ). Therefore, the method is also referred to as thermal ALD. Besides the atomic control over the film thickness, the self- limiting half- cycles in ALD facilitate uniform deposition over large substrates and conformal deposition in structures of high aspect ratio, as long as the dosing and purge times are sufficiently long.",

The high reactivity of the plasma species on the deposition surface during the plasma- assisted ALD process allows for more freedom in processing conditions and for a wider range of material properties. These ideas will be addressed in detail later in this review article and are the primary reason why the interest in plasma- assisted ALD has increased rapidly in recent years. This interest has also been catalyzed by the many new applications of ALD that are emerging in and outside the semiconductor industry. Several non- semiconductor applications have set new requirements for the ALD parameter space, which cannot always be satisfied easily by a pure thermally- driven ALD process.",

Sherman filed a patent on the method in 1996,298 after which Rossnagel and co- workers reported on plasma- assisted ALD of Ta and Ti metal films in 2000.206 In the latter case, the anticipated application of the technique was the deposition of Cu diffusion barriers in advanced",

This means that the fluxes of electrons and ions to the deposition surface are much lower than the flux of the plasma radicals. Therefore, in many cases, the surface chemistry is ruled by the interaction of the plasma radicals with the surface species. However, the energy of the ions,  $E_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ , arriving at the surface can be much higher than the ion or electron temperature, as ions are accelerated within a thin positive space- charge layer, the \"plasma sheath,\" at the boundary between the plasma and the substrate. This plasma sheath develops because the electron thermal velocity is much higher than the ion thermal velocity. To make the net current to the substrate zero, an electrical field develops between the plasma and the substrate, which retards the electrons and accelerates the ions. Therefore an electropositive plasma is (time- averaged) always at a positive potential relative to any surface in contact with it.

The energy gained by the ions in the plasma sheath, and consequently whether \"ion bombardment\" can take place or not, also depends on the collisional mean free path of the ions and the thickness of the plasma sheath. At relatively low pressures, the ion mean free path is larger than the plasma sheath thickness, such that the ions can be accelerated over the full sheath (i.e. the plasma sheath is collisionless) and consequently  $E_{\\mathrm{ion}} = e(V_{p} - V_{f})$",

Due to technical constraints on existing ALD reactors, plasma generation typically takes place at a relatively far distance from ALD reaction zone. Consequently, the plasma species have to flow through the reactor tubing between the plasma source and reaction chamber. This allows for many surface collisions, where ions and electrons are lost before reaching the substrate due to their recombination at surfaces. Therefore, the method is typically referred to as \"radical- enhanced ALD\". The many surface collisions of the plasma species can, however, also significantly reduce the flux of radicals arriving at the substrate. This is especially prominent when the choice of the inner surface of the tubing material is not harmonized with the plasma radicals to reduce surface recombination. For example, H radicals have a relatively low surface recombination probability on quartz surfaces but a very high recombination probability on most metals (see Table II).

In principle, this enables uniform deposition over the full wafer area with short plasma exposure steps. Because of the relatively simple reactor layout and their proven performance in other plasma processing methods, direct plasmas are extensively used in industrial tools.

This configuration can be distinguished from radical- enhanced ALD by the fact that the plasma is still present above the deposition surface, i.e. the electron and ion densities have not decreased to zero.237,303 The \"downstream\" plasma can be of the afterglow type (where the local electron temperature is too low to be ionizing) or can still be active (ionizing). The flux of the radicals towards the substrate can therefore be much higher than for radical- enhanced ALD. Moreover, under these circumstances, the plasma and substrate conditions can be varied (relatively) independently of each other, something which is not the case for direct plasma ALD. For example, in direct plasma- assisted ALD a change in substrate temperature affects the gas temperature and consequently the density of gas- phase species and the generation of plasma species.299 Therefore, the remote nature of the remote plasma- assisted ALD configuration allows for more control of the plasma's composition and properties than is possible with direct- plasma ALD. The plasma properties can be optimized relatively easily by tuning the operating conditions of the plasma source and the downstream conditions at the position of the substrate. This holds specifically for the presence of ion bombardment and the influence of plasma radiation.303 Due to their high degree of flexibility remote plasma ALD reactors are therefore well suited for process design and other R&D applications.",

These initiatives mainly aim at obtaining additional control over the production of plasma species and over their interaction with the material surface. In the remote and direct- plasma configurations discussed so far, the substrate is generally placed on a grounded substrate stage. As a result, the potential over the plasma sheath and, consequently, the ion energy is relatively small. However, it is expected that some deposition processes can benefit from enhanced radical production and/or from enhanced ion energies. In that case the nongrounded substrate stage can be biased by a DC, AC, RF, or pulse- shaped signal, or a combination of different signals.317 Such methods were inspired by configurations designed for other plasma- assisted material processing techniques such as plasma etching, ion implantation, and deposition by PECVD or PVD.29 One configuration recently reported has a capacitively- coupled remote plasma (a direct plasma with a grid), in which a pulsed dc power was applied to the grid.138 It was reported that for the resulting negative grid voltage, both the electron temperature and plasma density increased resulting in a higher radical and ion flux to the substrate. It was stated that this improved the electrical properties of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  films, such as the effective oxide thickness and the breakdown voltage. Another embodiment is the application of an RF bias or self- bias voltage to the substrate stage in a remote plasma ICP reactor.318 Under properly chosen operating conditions, this leads to an enhanced energy of the ions impinging on the substrate, therefore yielding an additional control over the plasma- surface interaction in which the ion energy can be independently controlled from the ion and radical flux. It is expected that more results from these and other similar approaches will appear in the literature relatively soon.",

This has been confirmed by in situ infrared spectroscopy, which revealed that hydroxyl groups on  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surfaces are the dominant adsorption sites for  $\\mathrm{AlMe}_3$  during plasma- assisted ALD. For the thermal ALD process of  $\\mathrm{AlMe}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ , the GPC values are comparable but slightly lower than for plasma- assisted ALD at temperatures  $>200$ $^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ . However, it is at temperatures  $< 200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  that the main difference is observed, because here the GPC of thermal ALD drops significantly below that for plasma- assisted ALD. The thermal, energy at these temperatures is insufficient to allow for a full reaction of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  with the surface and so, in this case, high hydroxyl surface density cannot be created. Additionally for the thermal ALD process, the purge after the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  dose needs to be increased at low substrate temperatures to avoid parasitic CVD reactions. For temperatures  $>200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , purge times well below  $5\\mathrm{~s~}$  are sufficient (optimized industrial ALD reactors even use sub- second purges), whereas at  $58^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ,  $30\\mathrm{~s~}$  is required to completely remove residual water. At room temperature,  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films can still be synthesized by thermal ALD, but the purge time required becomes impractically long (up to  $180\\mathrm{~s~}$  at  $33^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ). For plasma- assisted ALD, the purge time can be kept relatively short, even at room temperature, in essence, equal to the time used at higher temperatures or only slightly extended. The structural properties of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  thin films are highly comparable for both thermal and plasma- assisted ALD using  $\\mathrm{AlMe}_3$  as a precursor. At lower substrate temperatures the film quality degrades slightly, as evidenced by a reduced mass density, an increased  $\\mathrm{O / Al}$  ratio, and a higher  $\\mathrm{H}$  concentration. Furthermore, small traces of C can be found in the films deposited at room temperature. For plasma- assisted ALD the C atoms are mainly incorporated as  $\\mathrm{CO}_x$  groups, the density of which can be reduced by increasing the plasma exposure time. Despite the somewhat lower material quality of the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  deposited at substrate temperatures  $< 150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , these films are considered very attractive for applications which require dense, amorphous and conformal  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films deposited at low temperatures.

The films have been deposited at substrate temperatures as low as 25, 50, 100, and  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. Moreover, the GPC values were marginally affected by the substrate temperature over the full temperature range (up to  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ). For thermal ALD, with either  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  or  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , the situation is quite different. Firstly, the GPC increases with substrate temperature, which indicates that the surface reactions are rate- limited by thermal activation. This holds for  $\\mathrm{Ti(O^iPr)_4}$  with both  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  (see Fig. 9), but also for  $\\mathrm{Ti(Cp^*)OMe)_3}$  with  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  (not shown). Furthermore, for all these precursors, the GPC for the thermal process is lower than that for plasma- assisted ALD (except for the case of  $\\mathrm{Ti(O^iPr)_4}$  with  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , where the high GPC has been attributed to thermal decomposition of the precursor. This clearly demonstrates that an  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma is not only more reactive than  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  but is also more effective than  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , particularly at lower temperatures. In addition,  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasmas (and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ ) allow for the use of  $\\mathrm{Cp}$ - based Ti precursors, which show almost no reactivity against  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  in ALD processes.

In such capacitors the use of  $\\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$  is being considered as an ultra- high-  $k$  dielectric, e.g. in upcoming technology nodes of DRAM devices.  $\\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$  can be deposited by the combination of  $\\mathrm{TiO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{SrO}$  ALD cycles into so- called \"supercycles\" for which an overlap in temperature window of the two ALD processes is demanded.

These can be substrates with surface structures of high aspect ratio (e.g. wafers with trenches or vias) or substrate materials with very high surface areas (e.g. porous materials and stacked particles). Thermal ALD is known to be the method of choice for depositing conformal thin films on such substrates, as film growth is self- limiting and independent of the precursor flux when the conditions are such that saturation of the ALD (half- ) reactions is reached. The difference between plasma- assisted and thermal ALD, in this respect, is that plasma- assisted ALD involves reactive species that not only undergo ALD reactions (as in thermal ALD) but can also react on saturated surface sites. As mentioned in Sec. II, radicals from the plasma can react with other radicals and species residing at the surface, forming nonreactive molecules that desorb back into the plasma. In the case of high- aspect- ratio structures or porous materials, the radicals have to undergo several surface collisions in order to reach deep inside the surface features, which significantly reduces the local flux of the radicals due to the surface recombination. This has only recently been addressed qualitatively by simulations and experimentally.42,304,336,337 In many other reports, the impact of the surface recombination of plasma radicals is generalized and the poor conformality of plasma- assisted ALD films is often claimed. However, the conformality achieved by plasma- assisted ALD under certain conditions depends strongly on the value of the recombination probability,  $r$ , which itself depends on (a) the type of radicals responsible for film growth in a certain plasma- assisted ALD process and (b) the material being deposited (see Table II). Note that the surface temperature can also affect the value of  $r$ , for example, a significant temperature dependence was reported for oxygen radicals on silica,305 whereas the temperature dependence of H radicals on metals was less prominent.306 The influence of the value of  $r$  can be illustrated by the results obtained from simple two- dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, in which the evolution of the deposition profile within a trench of high aspect ratio was studied as a function of the incoming radical flux.304,337 This was achieved by considering only the plasma exposure step during a single ALD cycle.

The \"sticking\" probability of the radicals on unreacted surface sites was assumed to be 0.01. From the figure it is clear that for the smaller  $r$  values and reasonable aspect ratios  $(\\leq 10)$ , conformal deposition can still be achieved relatively easily by increasing the plasma exposure time by, for example, up to 10 times longer than that required for a planar substrate. However, for very high aspect ratios (e.g.  $\\geq 30$ ) plasma exposure times are necessary that are practically unfeasible. Consequently, because most current applications have reasonable aspect ratios, it can be concluded that in many practical cases, conformal deposition in high- aspect- ratio structures can certainly be achieved by plasma- assisted ALD. This is also confirmed by the results obtained for several metal oxides where the  $r$  values of oxygen radicals are known to be relatively low.<sup>60,199,200,210,246,339,340</sup> For other cases, such as metals, the  $r$  values of radicals are relatively high.

However, there is still a significant possibility that ion bombardment may be of influence because the performance of most semiconductor devices, in which the ultra- thin ALD- synthesized films are employed, is strongly affected by their interface properties. The influence of ion bombardment was illustrated by a study in which the material properties of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  films deposited in a remote plasma and a direct plasma reactor were compared. The films deposited in the remote plasma reactor were amorphous, but showed better interface properties than the polycrystalline  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  films deposited in the direct plasma reactor (also see Sec. VIb). Consequently, the electrical properties of the films, such as dielectric constant, fixed oxide charge density, and carrier mobility were superior for the remote plasma case. As exemplified by this study, the influence of plasma damage is more likely when the flux of ions is considerable, such as in direct plasma- assisted ALD. Another often neglected, but in many cases even more important, mechanism is defect creation by plasma radiation. As mentioned earlier, a significant amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is formed in plasmas, the energy of which can reach up to  $10\\mathrm{eV}$  (see Fig. 6). Oxides, such as  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  as well as the high-  $k$  oxides, have band gap values smaller than  $9\\mathrm{eV}$  meaning that vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation can create defects, for example, by photoemission or photoinjection of charge. Plasma- induced defect creation has been studied in great detail for the plasma processing of  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ - based gate stacks and the influence of VUV exposure has also recently been studied for the high-  $k$  oxide  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ . However, this damage mechanism has not really been highlighted for plasma- assisted ALD processes, for example, during the synthesis of metal oxides by plasma- assisted ALD itself or when depositing other materials (such as electrode materials) on top of high-  $k$  oxides by plasma- assisted ALD. Note that, apart from the fact that the metal oxide film might itself be affected, the interfacial  $\\mathrm{SiO}_x$  layer, which is typically present (either unintentionally or prepared on purpose) between the metal oxide and the Si substrate, can also be affected. From experiments (see Fig. 14(a)), it has recently been demonstrated that the surface passivation of crystalline Si by as- deposited  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  is strongly affected by defects generated by VUV photons from the  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma (photon energy of  $9.5\\mathrm{eV}$ , see Fig. 6). To illustrate that VUV radiation is responsible for the degradation in surface passivation, a silicon wafer coated with thermal ALD- deposited  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  (30 nm in thickness) was exposed to an  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma through  $5.0\\mathrm{mm}$  quartz and  $\\mathrm{MgF_2}$  windows covering the sample which would either block or transmit the  $9.5\\mathrm{eV}$  photons, respectively. The results, which are presented in Fig. 14(b), demonstrate that no degradation in lifetime is observed when the VUV radiation was blocked by the quartz window. However, for the exposure through the  $\\mathrm{MgF_2}$  window, the lifetime degraded with a rate equal to that obtained when no window was used (after correcting for the  $\\sim 60\\%$  transmittance of the  $\\mathrm{MgF_2}$  window at  $130.5\\mathrm{nm}$  wavelength). The photons emitted by the  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma during plasma- assisted ALD induce a very high interface defect density  $(D_{it}\\approx 10^{12}\\mathrm{eV}^{- 1}\\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$  at the midgap) such that extremely high surface recombination velocities of  $10^{7}\\mathrm{cm / s}$  were obtained. However, most of these surface defects can be removed by annealing the films for  $10\\mathrm{min}$  at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  in  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  ( $D_{it}$  reduced to  $\\sim 10^{11}\\mathrm{eV}^{- 1}\\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$ ), such that excellent surface recombination velocities, as low as  $1\\mathrm{cm / s}$ , can be achieved on low- resistivity float- zone Si. These surface recombination velocities correspond to a surface passivation quality not yet paralleled by any other material. On the other hand, as- deposited  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  synthesized by thermal ALD affords reasonably low surface recombination velocities, as the films are not exposed to VUV radiation from a plasma (despite this fact, the level of surface passivation after annealing is not as good as for  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  synthesized with by plasma- assisted ALD). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the level of surface passivation by as- deposited  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  synthesized by plasma- assisted ALD can be increased by decreasing the length of the plasma exposure",

To assess their possible impact on the potential applications of the plasma- assisted ALD method, a deeper investigation of the underlying surface processes, including the plasma- surface interaction, is required in order to establish whether they lead to problems for the specific applications considered. Another class of challenges is related to the development of equipment and the industrial scale- up of the process. The use of plasma steps during ALD cycles requires more complex equipment than that used for thermal ALD. Unless this additional complexity is compensated for by the significant advantages of plasma- assisted ALD, thermal ALD will be the method of choice. For research and development (R&D), the interest in plasma- assisted ALD equipment is hardly or not affected, as R&D equipment is required to directly compare the results obtained by plasma and thermal ALD. This is evidenced by the fact that several combined plasma and thermal ALD tools have recently been introduced onto the market. However, for industrial scale- up the situation is different. Here, plasma- assisted ALD will only be adopted when it provides major benefits over thermal ALD and when alternative deposition techniques are not available for the specific applications envisioned. The latter situation is currently prominent in the field of crystalline silicon photovoltaics, where mainly thermal ALD is currently considered by equipment manufacturers for the scale- up of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  deposition,18,353- 355 despite the fact that plasma- assisted ALD can provide significant benefits over thermal ALD in this case.356",

At that time, the replacement of Al by Cu as the interconnect material was imminent and plasma- assisted ALD processes for the deposition of Ta and Ti liners were developed.206 Such liner materials became necessary to prevent Cu diffusion into the low-  $k$  dielectric and to promote the adhesion of Cu to the diffusion barrier layer.357 For this application, typically a stack of materials, such as TaN/Ta or TiN/Ti, needs to be employed and these materials need to be deposited in the trenches and vias before filling them with Cu. Therefore, in addition to the good barrier and adhesion properties, other requirements for the liner materials include a high conformality of the films in nanoscale structures, a deposition temperature compatible with back- end- of- line processing  $(\\leq 400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  , as well as a high chemical and thermal stability. Also the resistivity should be low to keep the total resistance of the interconnects as low as possible and to allow for metal layers to be connected through the barrier layers. In particular cases, a low- resistivity barrier and adhesion layer could also simultaneously act as a seed- layer for the electrochemical deposition process of Cu.161,166,180- 183,220,240",

IV, no thermal ALD processes exist for these metals, but the deposition of Ta and Ti films by plasma- assisted ALD was successful (see Fig. 15).

Also, the growth per cycle was higher.134 Maeng et al. also reported two different experiments in which a  $\\mathrm{HfO_xN_y}$  layer was incorporated within an  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  film by varying the plasma composition during the ALD process.116,143 In this case the precursor was  $\\mathrm{Hf(NMe_2)_4}$ , whereas the reactant was varied from an  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma to an  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  plasma or an  $\\mathrm{O}_2 / \\mathrm{N}_2$  plasma. The films possessed a higher  $k$ - value, a lower interface defect density  $D_{\\mathrm{it}}$  and a lower or comparable leakage current density. The latter was attributed to the presence of  $\\mathrm{N - H}$  bonds, which block leakage paths and suppress conduction band lowering and reduce trap sites.116 Besides the plasma composition, the reactor choice can also influence the material properties, as already mentioned in Sec. V. Kim et al. reported polycrystalline  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  films deposited from  $\\mathrm{Hf(NEt_2)_4}$  and an  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma in a direct plasma reactor compared to amorphous films obtained with the same ALD chemistry in a remote plasma (See Fig. 17).123,125 In addition to better dielectric properties, MOSFET devices that were prepared using remote- plasma ALD  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  showed better interface properties and a lower fixed oxide charge density. The difference in material properties was attributed to the increased physical reactivity of the direct plasma, in terms of ion bombardment (see Sec. V). On the other hand, a beneficial effect of some (mild) ion bombardment was also demonstrated in a recent study.  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  was deposited using  $\\mathrm{Hf(NEtMe)_4}$  and an  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma in a capacitively- coupled remote plasma reactor (see Sec. III) in which the grid between the driven electrode and the substrate carrier was biased. Films deposited with a  $30~\\mathrm{W}$  bias power resulted in films with a lower EOT and a higher breakdown electric field than those in an unbiased situation.138",

In several cases, films of reasonably high quality can even be deposited at temperatures of  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  and lower. This merit of plasma- assisted ALD has recently led to a development of high interest to the semiconductor industry. In order to keep up with the future demands of miniaturization, extreme- UV lithography (13.5 nm wavelength) is being developed. However, methods such as double exposure and double patterning361,362 are being adopted in the interim to extend the versatility of current lithography methods (193 nm wavelength) while still allowing for smaller structures to be defined. Recently an alternative form of double patterning, requiring only one lithography step instead of two, has been developed. This spaced- defined double- patterning method, which is currently being introduced in DRAM manufacturing for the fabrication of the next generation of logic devices, employs a low temperature plasma- assisted ALD step.13,321,363",

        "text": "With the growing need for high quality ultra- thin and conformal films, in and outside the semiconductor industry, the number of applications of ALD will grow substantially in the next decade. As a consequence, the requirements on process conditions and material properties will increase and diversify, requiring new experimental approaches and a variety of ALD equipment configurations. As plasma- assisted ALD can provide some unique merits over the thermal ALD method, it is expected that the interest in this method will also keep growing considerably. This increase in interest is already currently manifested by the number of ALD equipment manufacturers providing dedicated plasma- assisted ALD tools, which has increased significantly in the last few years. The demand for plasma- assisted ALD equipment from industrial R&D laboratories has, in particular, appeared to be high. It is likely that this is fueled by the fact that industrial laboratories are particularly focused on equipment that provides a high degree of flexibility in combination with a robustness of the equipment and processes. In this respect, plasma- based techniques have been well- accepted in thin film and device manufacturing. Nevertheless, plasma- assisted ALD also faces several challenges. In order to address the question whether and when aspects inherent to the plasma- based process will provide principal limitations for certain applications, a deeper understanding of film growth by plasma- assisted ALD is required. Therefore, more insight into the underlying surface reactions and the role of the plasma- surface interaction needs to be obtained. This is quite a challenging task, but, consequently, also an appealing one considering the complexity of plasma processes. Also of vital importance is that plasma- assisted ALD equipment for high volume manufacturing will be developed and implemented. In the case where (multiple) single wafer reactors are used, the implementation of a plasma source is relatively easy.13 Recently, however, the first results were presented on plasma- assisted ALD an inline spatial ALD system66 while also the first results obtained in a multiwafer ALD batch reactor equipped with plasma source were presented.370 Furthermore, in 2007 a patent was filed on roll- to- roll ALD using an atmospheric plasma371 by FujiFilm Manufacturing Europe.372 Generally for plasma- assisted ALD, it would be best to focus initially on applications for which no alternative deposition techniques exist, or on applications for which the merits of plasma- assisted ALD are substantial and critical. Once established, the method will certainly find more applications and plasma- assisted ALD will complement existing thin film manufacturing techniques.",
