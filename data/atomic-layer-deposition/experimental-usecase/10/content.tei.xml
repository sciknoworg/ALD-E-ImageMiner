<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an energy-enhanced method for the synthesis of ultra-thin films with A ˚-level resolution in which a plasma is employed during one step of the cyclic deposition process. The use of plasma species as reactants allows for more freedom in processing conditions and for a wider range of material properties compared with the conventional thermallydriven ALD method. Due to the continuous miniaturization in the microelectronics industry and the increasing relevance of ultra-thin films in many other applications, the deposition method has rapidly gained popularity in recent years, as is apparent from the increased number of articles published on the topic and plasma-assisted ALD reactors installed. To address the main differences between plasma-assisted ALD and thermal ALD, some basic aspects related to processing plasmas are presented in this review article. The plasma species and their role in the surface chemistry are addressed and different equipment configurations, including radical-enhanced ALD, direct plasma ALD, and remote plasma ALD, are described. The benefits and challenges provided by the use of a plasma step are presented and it is shown that the use of a plasma leads to a wider choice in material properties, substrate temperature, choice of precursors, and processing conditions, but that the processing can also be compromised by reduced film conformality and plasma damage. Finally, several reported emerging applications of plasma-assisted ALD are reviewed. It is expected that the merits offered by plasma-assisted ALD will further increase the interest of equipment manufacturers for developing industrial-scale deposition configurations such that the method will find its use in several manufacturing applications.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor-phase deposition technique in which ultra-thin films are typically synthesized sub-monolayer by sub-monolayer by repeating two subsequently executed half-cycles. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> See Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for a schematic illustration of an ALD cycle. ALD offers atomic layer precision of the growth, because the reaction of the species dosed during the two half-cycles is self-limiting. As a consequence, when sufficient precursor and reactant species are dosed, the ALD film growth is not flux-dependent, as is the case with deposition techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD). The growth rate with respect to ALD is expressed as the growth per cycle (GPC), which is typically in the range of 0.05-0.1 nm per cycle. In order to ensure that only ALD surface reactions take place and not CVD-like reactions, which can appear when precursor and reactant are present in the reactor at the same time, a purge step is executed after each halfcycle to remove the residual precursor or reactant species. The total duration of a cycle is the sum of the precursor dos-ing time, the precursor purge time, the reactant dose time and the reactant purge time. Consequently, the duration of one cycle cannot only be shortened by optimizing the dosing times, but also by optimizing the purge times. During ALD, the reactant is typically a gas, such as O 2 , or a vapor, such as H 2 O, and the surface reactions are thermally-driven by slightly elevated substrate temperatures (typically 150-350 C). Therefore, the method is also referred to as thermal ALD. Besides the atomic control over the film thickness, the self-limiting half-cycles in ALD facilitate uniform deposition over large substrates and conformal deposition in structures of high aspect ratio, as long as the dosing and purge times are sufficiently long.</p><p>The first ALD research was conducted in the 1960s and 1970s in the former USSR and Finland, and the deposition method was patented in 1977 by <ref type="bibr">Suntola. 11</ref> For a more extensive review on the history of ALD, the reader is referred to Puurunen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In the mid-1990s, the semiconductor industry became interested in ALD because a deposition method with atomic control over the film thickness and the ability to deposit films conformally on nonplanar substrates was needed. Since then, the semiconductor industry has been the key driver of the field of ALD. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> In 2007, Intel introduced its first 45 nm microprocessor containing Hf-based gate dielectric layers fabricated by ALD. It is expected that, starting from the 22 nm technology node, ALD will be used in several key process steps. <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> Plasma-assisted ALD is an energy-enhanced ALD method that is rapidly gaining in popularity. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> In plasmaassisted ALD, also referred to as plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD), plasma ALD and, in some cases, radicalenhanced ALD, the surface is exposed to the species generated by a plasma during the reactant step. This process is also illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Typical plasmas used during plasma-assisted ALD are those generated in O 2 , N 2 and H 2 reactant gases or combinations thereof. Such plasmas can replace ligand-exchange reactions typical of H 2 O or NH 3 , and they can be employed to deposit metal oxides, metal nitrides and metal films. Moreover, plasmas generated in gases or vapors such as NH 3 and H 2 O have been reported, for which there can also be a combination of plasma and thermal ALD surface reactions taking place at the same time.</p><p>Plasma-assisted ALD offers several merits for the deposition of ultra-thin films over thermal ALD and other vaporphase deposition techniques. The high reactivity of the plasma species on the deposition surface during the plasmaassisted ALD process allows for more freedom in processing conditions and for a wider range of material properties. These ideas will be addressed in detail later in this review article and are the primary reason why the interest in plasmaassisted ALD has increased rapidly in recent years. This interest has also been catalyzed by the many new applications of ALD that are emerging in and outside the semiconductor industry. Several non-semiconductor applications have set new requirements for the ALD parameter space, which cannot always be satisfied easily by a pure thermally-driven ALD process.</p><p>The increasing popularity of plasma-assisted ALD is manifested by the increasing number of recent publications about the topic (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), and the large set of thin film materials that have been synthesized by the method (see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). Such is the interest and demand in the field that the number of ALD equipment manufacturers providing dedicated plasma-assisted ALD tools has increased significantly in the recent years. Currently (status May 2011), companies such as ASM (Emerald (2005) and Stellar (2006)), <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Oxford Instruments (FlexAL (2006) and OpAL (2008)), <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Beneq (TFS 200 (2009)), <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Cambridge NanoTech (Fiji (2009)), <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Applied Materials (Applied Endura iLB (2010)), <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Tokyo Electron Limited (TELINDY PLUS IRad SA (2011)), <ref type="bibr">21</ref> and Picosun (SUNALE (2011)) <ref type="bibr">22</ref> provide tools for plasmaassisted ALD.</p><p>The first case of plasma-assisted ALD was reported in 1991, when De Keijser and Van Opdorp of the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, published a paper on atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) of GaAs using H radicals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">111</ref> The hydrogen radicals were generated in a remote microwave-induced plasma and transported to the deposition surface through a quartz tube (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The atomic hydrogen was used to drive the surface reactions after GaMe 3 and AsH 3 pulsing at substrate temperatures below 500 C, which is close to the onset temperature for the thermal decomposition of GaMe 3 . Subsequently, the method remained unexplored until the end of the 1990s, when the semiconductor industry became interested in ALD as mentioned earlier. Sherman filed a patent on the method in 1996, <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">298</ref> after which Rossnagel and co-workers reported on plasma-assisted ALD of Ta and Ti metal films in 2000. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">206</ref> In the latter case, the anticipated application of the technique was the deposition of Cu diffusion barriers in advanced FIG. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PLASMA BASICS</head><p>A plasma is a collection of free, charged particles, among other gas-phase species, which is, on average, electrically neutral. <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">299,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">300</ref> This so-called quasi-neutrality means that at macroscopic length scales (typically &gt;1 mm) the electron density is equal to the ion density, i.e. n e ¼ n i , under the assumption that negative ions can be neglected. In most plasma configurations, plasmas are created by electrical fields which lead to acceleration and heating of the electrons. These hot electrons are able to ionize gas-phase species through electron-induced collisions and, as such, they can compensate for electron-loss collisions and consequently sustain the plasma. Typically, the average electron temperature (a measure for the kinetic electron energy), T e , is $3.5 Â 10 4 K (approximately 3 eV) while the gas temperature remains low (T gas ¼ 300-500 K).

The electrons in the high-energy tail of the energy distribution are not only able to ionize species, but they can also dissociate and excite the reactant gas through electronimpact collisions. This leads to the formation of reactive atomic and molecular neutrals (typically referred to as "plasma radicals"), ions, and photons. Subsequently, these species can undergo additional gas-phase reactions and they can induce surface reactions when they arrive at deposition or reactor surfaces. Although the charged particles play a central role in sustaining the plasma, the fractional ionization or "ionization degree" of processing plasmas is very low, typically within the range 10 À6 -10 À3 . This means that the fluxes of electrons and ions to the deposition surface are much lower than the flux of the plasma radicals. Therefore, in many cases, the surface chemistry is ruled by the interaction of the plasma radicals with the surface species. However, the energy of the ions, E ion , arriving at the surface can be much higher than the ion or electron temperature, as ions are accelerated within a thin positive space-charge layer, the "plasma sheath," at the boundary between the plasma and the substrate. This plasma sheath develops because the electron thermal velocity is much higher than the ion thermal velocity. To make the net current to the substrate zero, an electrical field develops between the plasma and the substrate, which retards the electrons and accelerates the ions. Therefore an electropositive plasma is (time-averaged) always at a positive potential relative to any surface in contact with it. In the rudimentary case of a floating substrate, the difference between the plasma potential, V p , and the substrate potential, V f , is generally given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V P À V f ¼ T e 2e þ T e 2e ln m i 2pm e ;</formula><p>where T e is the electron energy in eV, and m e and m i are the electron and ion mass, respectively. This means that V p ÀV f is typically a few multiples of T e . The energy gained by the ions in the plasma sheath, and consequently whether "ion bombardment" can take place or not, also depends on the collisional mean free path of the ions and the thickness of the plasma sheath. At relatively low pressures, the ion mean free path is larger than the plasma sheath thickness, such that the ions can be accelerated over the full sheath (i.e. the plasma sheath is collisionless) and consequently</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E ion ¼ e(V p ÀV f ).</formula><p>For typical processing plasmas, the potential over the plasma sheath is &lt;50 V, however, depending on the plasma gas, the reactor geometry and substrate stage configuration (symmetry or asymmetry of the electrodes, grounding or biasing of electrode/substrate stage, etc.), this potential can also be as high as a few hundreds of Volts. Examples of energy distributions for ions arriving at substrates for O 2 , N 2 , and H 2 plasmas under specific ALD conditions in a reactor equipped with an inductively-coupled plasma are given in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. At higher pressures, however, the plasma sheath becomes collisional and the net energy gained by the ions is much smaller as a result. Also note that the ions in the plasma sheath are accelerated in the direction perpendicular to the (local) surface. This means that the flux of the ions to the surface is anisotropic with the ions having an angle of incidence around the normal to the surface.</p><p>The key properties of the plasma step, executed during the synthesis of thin film materials by plasma-assisted ALD, are</p><p>(1) The reactive species are created in the gas-phase, which means that a relatively high reactivity can be provided to the deposition surface (almost) independently of the FIG. 4. (Color online) Ion energy distribution as measured by a retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) in O 2 , H 2 and N 2 plasmas (operating pressure: 8 mTorr; plasma power: 100 W) used for remote plasma-assisted ALD. The RFEA was positioned at the substrate stage. Measurements were performed in the home-built ALD-I reactor installed at Eindhoven University of Technology. Due to non-ideal effects such as capacitive coupling, the ion energies measured are higher than those measured in the Oxford Instruments FlexAL reactor, which are reported elsewhere (Ref. 303).</p><p>substrate conditions (e.g. substrate temperature and substrate materials). The reactivity of the plasma can also be "selective" (e.g. in terms of reactive species produced) by tuning its properties and composition by carefully choosing the plasma operating conditions (gases, flows, power, pressure, etc.).</p><p>(2) Typically the plasma supplies a relatively low heat flux to the surface, despite its high reactivity. The reason is that, for cold plasmas, only the electrons are heated significantly and not the other gas-phase species. Furthermore, plasma exposure takes place only during a part of the cycle (typically only for a few seconds) which does not allow the plasma to extensively heat the substrate.</p><p>(3) Through ion bombardment, additional energy can be provided to the deposition surface. This energy is locally dissipated by the surface species and can enhance surface reaction rates and processes such as surface diffusion. Possible ion-surface interactions are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> for typical ranges of ion energy and ion flux towards the substrate, corresponding to various plasma-assisted techniques. Moreover, the presence and level of ion bombardment can be controlled through the plasma operating conditions (mainly the gas pressure) as well as by the choice of plasma configuration and substrate (stage) conditions (e.g. grounded substrate, stage size and substrate bias).</p><p>These key properties can be summarized by the phrase: plasmas can deliver a high, diverse but selective reactivity to a surface without heat, and can therefore access a parameter space in materials processing, which is not easily accessible with strictly chemical methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">299,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">300</ref> Other key differences between plasma-assisted ALD and thermal ALD include.</p><p>(1) Electron-impact collisions, as well as other reactions, which lead to the excitation of atoms and molecules.

V). <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">303</ref> (2) Creation of reactant species from the reactant gas during the plasma step, which are mainly radicals. Apart from the ALD surface reactions, these radicals can also undergo additional reactions at the surface, even at saturated surface sites. For example, radicals can recombine on wall (and deposition) surfaces to form nonreactive molecules that desorb back into the plasma. The probability of such recombination reactions, the so-called surface recombination probability, r, can be as small as 10 À6 and as high as 1 (see Table <ref type="table">II</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">304</ref> The value of r has a direct impact on the density of the radicals in the plasma as it defines the surface loss term for the radicals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Radical-enhanced ALD</head><p>In the first configuration, a plasma generator is fitted to a thermal ALD reactor, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(a)</ref>. Examples of such plasma sources are microwave surfatron systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">100</ref> and the radiofrequency-driven R*Evolution (MKS Instruments) <ref type="bibr">315</ref> and Litmas RPS (Advanced Energy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">316</ref> systems, which are also commonly used for plasma-based reactor cleaning. Due to technical constraints on existing ALD reactors, plasma generation typically takes place at a relatively far distance from ALD reaction zone. Consequently, the plasma species have to flow through the reactor tubing between the plasma source and reaction chamber. This allows for many surface collisions, where ions and electrons are lost before reaching the substrate due to their recombination at surfaces. Therefore, the method is typically referred to as "radical-enhanced ALD". The many surface collisions of the plasma species can, however, also significantly reduce the flux of radicals arriving at the substrate. This is especially prominent when the choice of the inner surface of the tubing material is not harmonized with the plasma radicals to reduce surface recombination. For example, H radicals have a relatively low surface recombination probability on quartz surfaces but a very high recombination probability on most metals (see Table <ref type="table">II</ref>). In the case of metallic surfaces, very long radical exposure times might be necessary to reach saturation of the reactant step in the ALD cycle.</p></div>

In this case, a capacitively-coupled plasma is generated at radio frequency, (RF, typically 13.56 MHz), between two parallel electrodes in a so-called RF parallel plate or RF diode reactor, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(b</ref>).

The ALD reactors provided by ASM (Emerald and Stellar) <ref type="bibr">16</ref> and Beneq (TFS 200), <ref type="bibr">18</ref> for example, can be classified as direct-plasma ALD reactors. Typical operating pressures used during the plasma step in direct plasma ALD are of the order of 1 Torr, <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">200</ref> although these also could be &lt;100 mTorr for an RF parallel plate reactor. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> During direct plasma-assisted ALD, the fluxes of plasma radicals and ions towards the deposition surface can be very high, as the plasma species are created in very close proximity of the substrate surface.

Because of the relatively simple reactor layout and their proven performance in other plasma processing methods, direct plasmas are extensively used in industrial tools.</p><p>Depending on the voltage applied to the powered electrode and the operating pressure, the energy of the ions arriving on the substrate can, however, be substantial. In addition, the emission of high energy photons can be significant, possibly leading to plasma damage. The extent of plasma induced damage is, however, determined by the specific implementation of the plasma source and the processing conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Remote plasma ALD</head><p>A third configuration for plasma-assisted ALD equipment can be classified as "remote plasma ALD." In this case, as its name implies, the plasma source is located remotely from the substrate stage such that the substrate is not involved in the generation of the plasma species, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(c</ref>). This configuration can be distinguished from radical-enhanced ALD by the fact that the plasma is still present above the deposition surface, i.e. the electron and ion densities have not decreased to zero. <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">237,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">303</ref> The "downstream" plasma can be of the afterglow type (where the local electron temperature is too low to be ionizing) or can still be active (ionizing). The flux of the radicals towards the substrate can therefore be much higher than for radical-enhanced ALD. Moreover, under these circumstances, the plasma and substrate conditions can be varied (relatively) independently of each other, something which is not the case for direct plasma ALD. For example, in direct plasma-assisted ALD a change in substrate temperature affects the gas temperature and consequently the density of gas-phase species and the generation of plasma species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">299</ref> Therefore, the remote nature of the remote plasma-assisted ALD configuration allows for more control of the plasma's composition and properties than is possible with direct-plasma ALD. The plasma properties can be optimized relatively easily by tuning the operating conditions of the plasma source and the downstream conditions at the position of the substrate. This holds specifically for the presence of ion bombardment and the influence of plasma radiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">303</ref> Due to their high degree of flexibility remote plasma ALD reactors are therefore well suited for process design and other R&amp;D applications.</p><p>A variety of plasma sources can be employed for remote plasma-assisted ALD, including microwave plasmas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">111</ref> electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasmas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">152</ref> and RFdriven inductively-coupled plasmas (ICP). <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">206</ref> The latter type, either with a cylindrical or planar coil, is currently the TABLE III.

The excited species O * and O 2 * correspond to the lowest metastable states being O ( 1 D) and O 2 (a 1 D g ), respectively. Note that the calculated ion energy is lower than the measured ion energy reported on in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, probably as a result of a different reactor geometry and capacitive-coupling of the plasma between the coil and the grounded reactor wall.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Pressure (mTorr) O 2 (cm À3 ) O (cm À3 ) O 2 * (cm À3 ) O * (cm À3 ) O 2 þ (cm À3 ) O þ (cm À3 ) O -(cm À3 ) n e (cm</formula><p>À3 ) T e (eV) E ion (eV) 10 3 Â 10 14 7 Â 10 13 4 Â 10 13 4 Â 10 12 5 Â 10 10 4 Â 10 10 2 Â 10 10 7 Â 10 10 2.8 15.3 100 3 Â 10 15 1 Â 10 14 3 Â 10 14 5 Â 10 10 4 Â 10 10 1 Â 10 9 3 Â 10 10 2 Â 10 10 2.1 10.8 050801-9 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-9 JVST A -Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films</p><p>most popular and it has proven itself extensively as a plasma source in plasma etching. In the Oxford Instruments FlexAL and OpAL reactors, 17 a multiturn cylindrical coil surrounds an alumina discharge tube, while in the Cambridge Nano-Tech Fiji system 19 the inductor surrounds a quartz tube. The operating pressure for these ICP systems can be as high as 1 Torr (Ref. 229) but, in many cases, pressures &lt;100 mTorr are common. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">206</ref> For such low pressures, which are atypical for (thermal) ALD, the reactors are equipped with turbomolecular pumps. In remote plasma systems, the fact that the plasma source and substrate surface are separated also allows for easy use of in situ diagnostic techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">238</ref> An alternative approach is provided by Beneq in their TFS 200 system. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Although this is, in principle, a direct ALD reactor employing a capacitively-coupled plasma, a grid can be placed between the two electrodes creating a socalled triode configuration (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(d)</ref>). This enables confinement of the plasma between the driven electrode and the grid such that the deposition surface is not in contact with the active plasma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">62</ref> In essence, this leads to a lower ion energy and flux towards the deposition surface, and lower ion and photon fluxes towards the deposition surface but also to a somewhat reduced radical density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Developments related to plasma-assisted ALD reactors</head><p>Recently, there have been a number of other developments with respect to the aforementioned reactor configurations. These initiatives mainly aim at obtaining additional control over the production of plasma species and over their interaction with the material surface. In the remote and direct-plasma configurations discussed so far, the substrate is generally placed on a grounded substrate stage. As a result, the potential over the plasma sheath and, consequently, the ion energy is relatively small. However, it is expected that some deposition processes can benefit from enhanced radical production and/or from enhanced ion energies. In that case the nongrounded substrate stage can be biased by a DC, AC, RF, or pulse-shaped signal, or a combination of different signals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">317</ref> Such methods were inspired by configurations designed for other plasma-assisted material processing techniques such as plasma etching, ion implantation, and deposition by PECVD or PVD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">299</ref> One configuration recently reported has a capacitively-coupled remote plasma (a direct plasma with a grid), in which a pulsed dc power was applied to the grid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">138</ref> It was reported that for the resulting negative grid voltage, both the electron temperature and plasma density increased resulting in a higher radical and ion flux to the substrate. It was stated that this improved the electrical properties of HfO 2 films, such as the effective oxide thickness and the breakdown voltage. Another embodiment is the application of an RF bias or self-bias voltage to the substrate stage in a remote plasma ICP reactor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">318</ref> Under properly chosen operating conditions, this leads to an enhanced energy of the ions impinging on the substrate, therefore yielding an additional control over the plasma-surface interaction in which the ion energy can be independently controlled from the ion and radical flux. It is expected that more results from these and other similar approaches will appear in the literature relatively soon.</p></div>

Such precursors require more reactive co-reactants as they show no or low reactivity with H 2 O (in essence, they do not readily undergo hydrolysis reactions). Although the use of O 3 could also provide a solution in such cases, plasma-assisted ALD processes can give even more reactivity. The plasma-assisted method can also yield solutions when depositing non-oxidic materials such as metal nitrides and metals. In addition to a wider choice of precursors, plasma-assisted ALD processes also enable the deposition of more material systems, for example, of the elemental metals Ti and Ta (see also Sec.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. More processing versatility in general</head><p>The availability of a plasma source on an ALD reactor allows for several other in situ treatments of the deposition surface, deposited films, and reactor walls. Plasmas can be used for substrate pretreatment (e.g. oxidation by an O 2 plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">149</ref> and nitridation by NH 3 or N 2 plasmas <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">132</ref> ), substrate cleaning, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">98</ref> post-deposition treatments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">141,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">164</ref> and reactor wall conditioning and cleaning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">240</ref> For example, a layer of TiN covering the walls of the reactor can be removed easily by running a F-based plasma such as one generated in NF 3 or SF 6 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">136</ref> The aforementioned merits of plasma-assisted ALD can be illustrated in more detail by several results that have been reported for various material systems in the recent years.</p><p>The first example is the remote plasma-assisted ALD of Al 2 O 3 from AlMe 3 and an O 2 plasma, which can be compared to the thermal ALD case with H 2 O. For both ALD processes, the dominant reaction products during the precursor dosing step are CH 4 molecules. During the subsequent reactant step, however, different reaction products are produced for the thermal and plasma process. For thermal ALD, only CH 4 is created, whereas for plasma-assisted ALD, combustion-like reactions take place which result in the production of CO 2 and H 2 O. In the case where only monofunctional chemisorpion of AlMe 3 to the surface is assumed, the suggested dominant surface reactions for plasma-assisted ALD can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">55</ref> 1: AlOH ðadsÞ þ AlMe 3ðgÞ !

AlOH ðadsÞ þ CO 2ðgÞ þ H 2 O ðgÞ :</formula><p>The process and material properties of Al 2 O 3 films deposited by plasma-assisted ALD were compared directly with those for thermal ALD. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> show that the Al 2 O 3 films can be deposited by plasma-assisted ALD at substrate temperatures between 25 and 400 C. Data are provided for processes carried out in two ALD reactors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">323</ref> which differ in operating pressure by a factor of $10. It is clear that the GPC (growth per cycle) shows no dependence on the plasma operating pressure in this case. <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">323</ref> It can also be observed that the GPC increases proportionally with decreasing substrate temperature. Although this effect can partly be attributed to a slightly reduced mass density of the films for temperatures below 150 C, the change in GPC is predominantly caused by an increased incorporation of Al atoms into the film per cycle at lower substrate temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">56</ref> This number of Al atoms incorporated is related to a higher 050801-11 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-11 JVST A -Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films</p><p>surface density of hydroxyl groups at lower substrate temperatures. This has been confirmed by in situ infrared spectroscopy, which revealed that hydroxyl groups on Al 2 O 3 surfaces are the dominant adsorption sites for AlMe 3 during plasma-assisted ALD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">55</ref> For the thermal ALD process of AlMe 3 and H 2 O, the GPC values are comparable but slightly lower than for plasma-assisted ALD at temperatures &gt;200 C. However, it is at temperatures &lt;200 C that the main difference is observed, because here the GPC of thermal ALD drops significantly below that for plasma-assisted ALD. The thermal, energy at these temperatures is insufficient to allow for a full reaction of H 2 O with the surface and so, in this case, high hydroxyl surface density cannot be created. Additionally for the thermal ALD process, the purge after the H 2 O dose needs to be increased at low substrate temperatures to avoid parasitic CVD reactions. For temperatures &gt;200 C, purge times well below 5 s are sufficient (optimized industrial ALD reactors even use sub-second purges), whereas at 58 C, 30 s is required to completely remove residual water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">322</ref> At room temperature, Al 2 O 3 films can still be synthesized by thermal ALD, but the purge time required becomes impractically long (up to 180 s at 33 C).</p><p>For plasma-assisted ALD, the purge time can be kept relatively short, even at room temperature, in essence, equal to the time used at higher temperatures or only slightly extended. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">60</ref> The structural properties of Al 2 O 3 thin films are highly comparable for both thermal and plasma-assisted ALD using AlMe 3 as a precursor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b310">323</ref> At lower substrate temperatures the film quality degrades slightly, as evidenced by a reduced mass density, an increased O/Al ratio, and a higher H concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">60</ref> Furthermore, small traces of C can be found in the films deposited at room temperature. For plasma-assisted ALD the C atoms are mainly incorporated as CO x groups, the density of which can be reduced by increasing the plasma exposure time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">55</ref> Despite the somewhat lower material quality of the Al 2 O 3 deposited at substrate temperatures &lt;150 C, these films are considered very attractive for applications which require dense, amorphous and conformal Al 2 O 3 films deposited at low temperatures. Examples are given in Sec. VI. The plasma-assisted ALD of TiO 2 films from metal-organic precursors and an O 2 plasma is another case for which the merits of the plasma-based process can be illustrated. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, TiO 2 has also been deposited at low substrate temperatures by this method, using Ti(O i Pr) 4 , Ti(Cp Me )(O i Pr) 3 , Ti(Cp*)(OMe) 3 , and Ti(Cp Me )(NMe 2 ) 3 as precursors. The films have been deposited at substrate temperatures as low as 25, 50, 100, and 100 C, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">56</ref> Moreover, the GPC values were marginally affected by the substrate temperature over the full temperature range (up to 300 C). For thermal ALD, with either H 2 O or O 3 , the situation is quite different. <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">324,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b312">325</ref> Firstly, the GPC increases with substrate temperature, which indicates that the surface reactions are rate-limited by thermal activation. This holds for Ti(O i Pr) 4 with both H 2 O and O 3 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>), but also for Ti(Cp*)(OMe) 3 with O 3 (not shown). <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">326</ref> Furthermore, for all these precursors, the GPC for the thermal process is lower than that for plasma-assisted ALD (except for the case of Ti(O i Pr) 4 with O 3 at 300 C, where the high GPC has been attributed to thermal decomposition of the precursor <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">324</ref> ). This clearly demonstrates that an O 2 plasma is not only more reactive than H 2 O but is also more effective than O 3 , particularly at lower temperatures. In addition, O 2 plasmas (and O 3 ) allow for the use of Cp-based Ti precursors, which show almost no reactivity against H 2 O in ALD processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">326</ref> This exemplifies the fact that a wider range of precursors can be employed for use with plasma-assisted ALD. These relatively stable Cp-based precursors are currently of substantial interest for metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor applications. In such capacitors the use of SrTiO 3 is being considered as an ultra-high-k dielectric, e.g. in upcoming technology nodes of DRAM devices. SrTiO 3 can be deposited by the combination of TiO 2 and SrO ALD cycles into so-called "supercycles" for which an overlap in temperature window of the two ALD processes is demanded. In order to obtain SrTiO 3 dielectric films with the best electrical performance, the highest possible deposition temperature within the shared temperature window should be chosen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">195,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b314">327</ref> The fact that plasma-assisted ALD can lead to improved material properties has also been demonstrated by results on metallic TiN films. <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">233,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b223">237</ref> The combination of TiCl 4 with an H 2 /N 2 plasma yielded thin TiN films with an excellent resistivity and low impurity levels. These results greatly surpass the material quality achieved with the standard thermal process employing TiCl 4 and NH 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">233,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b223">237</ref> Alternatively, during a thermal ALD process also dimethyl hydrazine (N 2 H 2 Me 2 ) or hydrazine (N 2 H 4 ) can be used as reactants. These reactants are, however, less common and the results obtained so far are not as good as obtained with a H 2 /N 2 plasma.</p><p>During a plasma-assisted ALD cycle of TiN, the simplified surface reaction scheme can be described as 050801-12 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-12 In terms of acceptable material quality, thermal ALD of TiN is limited to the substrate temperature range of 300-400 C, while the plasma-assisted ALD process can yield fair material properties down to temperatures as low as 100 C as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>. For thicker films, resistivity values as low as 72 mX cm (400 C) and 209 mX cm (100 C) have been reported, which could be attributed to the low Cl concentrations of 0.1 and 2.1 at.%, respectively at these temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">237</ref> This is quite a promising achievement, since TiN has numerous applications, such as an electrode material in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors and as a metal gate in CMOS devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">328</ref> The ability of plasma-assisted ALD to synthesize materials which cannot (or hardly) be deposited by thermal ALD is exemplified by the case of TaN x . Thermal ALD processes using either metal halide or metal-organic precursors in combination with NH 3 always yield the highly resistive Ta 3 N 5 phase because the reducing power of NH 3 is insufficient to reduce the Ta oxidation state from þ 5 to þ 3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">329</ref> Cubic TaN, can be deposited by thermal ALD when N 2 H 4 is used as the reactant <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">330</ref> or with the help of additional reducing agents such as AlMe 3 or elemental Zn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">329,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b319">331</ref> However, these processes employ relatively uncommon reactant gases or additional reducing agent dosing steps, which add significantly more complexity to the deposition process. For plasma ALD processes, it is possible to deposit conductive cubic TaN films from metal-organic precursors using an H 2 plasma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">223,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">226</ref> This is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>, where the resistivity of TaN films, deposited using Ta(NMe 2 ) 5 as a precursor, as a function of the H 2 plasma exposure time is shown. It is clear that TaN films with resistivity values as low as 380 mX cm could be obtained for long plasma exposure times. In addition, the aforementioned highly resistive Ta 3 N 5 films can also be synthesized by plasma-assisted ALD using the same Ta(NMe 2 ) 5 precursor, either by admixing a small concentration of N 2 into the H 2 plasma or by operating the plasma in NH 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">223</ref> This process also exemplifies that plasmaassisted ALD offers good control over the film stoichiometry.</p><p>As another example, the ALD of metal films is considered, in particular the ALD of Pt. Materials from the Ptmetal group, with applications in nanoelectronics (as electrodes) and in catalysis, are among the exceptional cases of elemental metals for which thermal ALD is relatively straightforward. <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">332</ref> Pt can, for example, be deposited by thermal ALD using Pt(Cp Me )Me 3 as a precursor combined with O 2 gas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">333</ref> Assuming that analogous surface reactions to those reported for the thermal ALD process of Pt take place, <ref type="bibr" target="#b322">334</ref> it is likely that a reaction mechanism such as the following occurs in the case of plasma-assisted ALD:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1: 2 PtðCp Me ÞMe 3 ðgÞ þ 3 O ðadsÞ ! 2 PtðCp Me ÞMe 2 ðadsÞ þ CH 4ðgÞ þ CO 2ðgÞ þ H 2 O ðgÞ ; 2: 2 PtðCp Me ÞMe 2 ðadsÞ þ 48O ðgÞ ! 2 Pt ðsÞ þ 3 O ðadsÞ þ 16 CO 2ðgÞ þ 13 H 2 O ðgÞ :</formula><p>For ALD of Pt as well as for many other noble metal processes, a relatively long nucleation delay can occur on oxides and other starting surfaces, which is especially prominent when lower operating pressures are employed. However, this nucleation delay can be almost completely eliminated when an O 2 plasma is used instead of O 2 gas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">164</ref> as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. The plasma-assisted step makes the ALD process and thickness control more reliable, while also reducing the consumption of an expensive Pt precursor. Furthermore, when a  050801-13 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-13 JVST A -Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films</p><p>(seed) layer of Pt has been deposited by plasma-assisted ALD, the thermal process can be continued without disruption in the thickness increment per cycle (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>). Another interesting feature of the plasma-assisted ALD process is that PtO 2 films can also be deposited using the same precursor and an O 2 plasma, the only difference (compared to the plasma-assisted ALD of Pt) being the plasma exposure time. Pt can be deposited using short plasma exposure times, whereas relatively long plasma exposure times yield PtO 2 .</p><p>For the process reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>, these exposure times are 0.5 and 5.0 s, respectively. The GPC for PtO 2 is very similar to that for Pt (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>) even though the number of Pt atoms per cycle is lower. So far the only thermal ALD process for PtO x that has been reported was based on a combination of Pt(acac) 2 and O 3 , and was restricted to the small temperature window of 120-130 C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b323">335</ref> Another material from the Pt-group for which the nucleation delay can be reduced by the plasma-assisted process is Ru. Results obtained using Ru(Cp Et ) 2 as a precursor and a NH 3 plasma as the reactant, for example, are reported in the literature quite extensively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[165]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[166]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[167]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[168]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[169]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[170]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[171]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[172]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[173]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[174]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[175]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[176]</ref> Pure and smooth films with a low resistivity were deposited with substrate-dependent growth rates and nucleation delays ($20 cycles for TiN and almost none for SiO 2 ). NH 3 gas is not reactive with the precursor and the thermal ALD process does not result in film growth. However, O 2 gas can be used for thermal ALD of Ru and results in growth rates that are up to 4 times higher compared to the plasma-assisted ALD process with NH 3 plasma as the reactant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">173</ref> Ru films were also deposited by employing O 2 gas and an O 2 plasma as the reactant in deposition processes using RuCp(CO) 2 Et. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">179</ref> These processes revealed fairly high growth rates of $1 nm/cycle after nucleation delay of $45 and $85 cycles for plasma-assisted ALD and thermal ALD, respectively. The surface roughnesses were, however, somewhat higher than for the NH 3 plasma process. Besides the nucleation properties and the growth rate, the choice of the reactant can also depend on the other layers in the structure; O 2 gas or an O 2 plasma can oxidize a surface whereas the use a NH 3 plasma could lead to reduction and even nitridation of the surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">175</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CHALLENGES OF PLASMA-ASSISTED ALD</head><p>Although plasma-assisted ALD can offer several benefits over thermal ALD for selected applications, the method also faces a number of challenges when compared to its thermal counterpart.</p><p>One limitation of plasma-assisted ALD that is often highlighted is the reduced conformality or step coverage that can be achieved on nonplanar substrates. These can be substrates with surface structures of high aspect ratio (e.g. wafers with trenches or vias) or substrate materials with very high surface areas (e.g. porous materials and stacked particles). Thermal ALD is known to be the method of choice for depositing conformal thin films on such substrates, as film growth is self-limiting and independent of the precursor flux when the conditions are such that saturation of the ALD (half-) reactions is reached. The difference between plasma-assisted and thermal ALD, in this respect, is that plasma-assisted ALD involves reactive species that not only undergo ALD reactions (as in thermal ALD) but can also react on saturated surface sites. As mentioned in Sec. II, radicals from the plasma can react with other radicals and species residing at the surface, forming nonreactive molecules that desorb back into the plasma. In the case of high-aspect-ratio structures or porous materials, the radicals have to undergo several surface collisions in order to reach deep inside the surface features, which significantly reduces the local flux of the radicals due to the surface recombination. This has only recently been addressed qualitatively by simulations and experimentally. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b291">304,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b324">336,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b325">337</ref> In many other reports, the impact of the surface recombination of plasma radicals is generalized and the poor conformality of plasma-assisted ALD films is often claimed. However, the conformality achieved by plasmaassisted ALD under certain conditions depends strongly on the value of the recombination probability, r, which itself depends on (a) the type of radicals responsible for film growth in a certain plasma-assisted ALD process and (b) the material being deposited (see Table <ref type="table">II</ref>). Note that the surface temperature can also affect the value of r, for example, a significant temperature dependence was reported for oxygen radicals on silica, <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">305</ref> whereas the temperature dependence of H radicals on metals was less prominent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">306</ref> The influence of the value of r can be illustrated by the results obtained from simple two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, in which the evolution of the deposition profile within a trench of high aspect ratio was studied as a function of the incoming radical flux. <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">304,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b325">337</ref> This was achieved by considering only the plasma exposure step during a single ALD cycle. The information on the deposition profile at the side wall of the trench was derived from the number of ALD growth events as a 050801-14 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-14 J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 29, No. 5, Sep/Oct 2011</p><p>function of the side wall position. For r &gt; 0, it was found that the deposition profiles showed a minimum thickness at the region just above the bottom of the trench (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13(a)</ref>) and this minimum was more pronounced for larger values of r. The deposition profiles were clearly distinguishable from the cases in which the conformality was reactionlimited or diffusion-limited (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13(a)</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">338</ref> Therefore, in addition to these limiting cases (which are also observed for thermal ALD) a new recombination-limited regime was distinguished for the case of plasma-assisted ALD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">304</ref> In order to achieve conformal deposition while in this recombinationlimited regime, a longer plasma exposure time has to be employed. Compared to the case where r ¼ 0, the dose required for saturation increases considerably when increas-ing the value of r, especially for high aspect ratios. The latter is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>(b) for aspect ratios of 10 and 30 and for r values ranging from 0.01 to 0.3. The "sticking" probability of the radicals on unreacted surface sites was assumed to be 0.01. From the figure it is clear that for the smaller r values and reasonable aspect ratios ( 10), conformal deposition can still be achieved relatively easily by increasing the plasma exposure time by, for example, up to 10 times longer than that required for a planar substrate. However, for very high aspect ratios (e.g. !30) plasma exposure times are necessary that are practically unfeasible. Consequently, because most current applications have reasonable aspect ratios, it can be concluded that in many practical cases, conformal deposition in high-aspect-ratio structures can certainly be achieved by plasma-assisted ALD. This is also confirmed by the results obtained for several metal oxides where the r values of oxygen radicals are known to be relatively low. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">199,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">200,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">210,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">246,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b327">339,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b328">340</ref> For other cases, such as metals, the r values of radicals are relatively high. This makes it very difficult or even impossible to achieve a good conformality, especially for aspect ratios &gt;10. Finally, it should be noted that thermal ALD processes can also be subject to surface recombination losses of reactant species. For example, for some materials, O 3 also has considerable (nonzero) r values, which generally increase with surface temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b329">341,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b330">342</ref> In this case, conformal film growth might also be recombination-limited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">304,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b329">341</ref> A second limitation of plasma-assisted ALD that can have an important effect on certain applications can be described as plasma-induced damage. During the plasma step of the ALD cycle, the deposition surface is exposed to a multitude of reactive species from the plasma that can also induce undesired surface reactions, including oxidation and nitridation of the top surface layers of the substrate. <ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">175</ref> In the case of (enhanced) surface oxidation, the interaction of oxygen atoms with the substrate during the initial ALD cycles can result in a (thicker) interfacial oxide, for example, when metal oxides are deposited on silicon (see also Sec. VI B). <ref type="bibr" target="#b331">343</ref> Nitridation can take place when using N 2 -or NH 3based plasmas to deposit metal nitrides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">238</ref> Note that nitridation is often also employed on purpose, for example, to increase the stability or the relative permittivity (k-value) of oxides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">209</ref> Plasma-induced damage can also manifest itself by the formation of defects inside the material or at the surface onto which the film is deposited. The bombardment of the substrate by energetic ions, accelerated in the plasma sheath, can lead to bond-breaking, displacement of atoms in the surface region and charge accumulation on dielectric layers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">344,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">345</ref> Such ion bombardment effects are particularly important during plasma-activated processes, such as reactive ion etching, where the substrate is negatively biased to give the incoming ions kinetic energies of up to several hundreds of eV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">299,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">300</ref> During plasma-assisted ALD the ion energies are typically much lower due to grounding of the substrate stage and/or the high pressures employed (i.e., when the plasma sheath is collisional), meaning that they are typically below the damage threshold (e.g. the atom displacement threshold) and cannot cause 050801-15 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-15 JVST A -Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films</p><p>significant defect creation. However, there is still a significant possibility that ion bombardment may be of influence because the performance of most semiconductor devices, in which the ultra-thin ALD-synthesized films are employed, is strongly affected by their interface properties. The influence of ion bombardment was illustrated by a study in which the material properties of HfO 2 films deposited in a remote plasma and a direct plasma reactor were compared. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">125</ref> The films deposited in the remote plasma reactor were amorphous, but showed better interface properties than the polycrystalline HfO 2 films deposited in the direct plasma reactor (also see Sec. VIb). Consequently, the electrical properties of the films, such as dielectric constant, fixed oxide charge density, and carrier mobility were superior for the remote plasma case. As exemplified by this study, the influence of plasma damage is more likely when the flux of ions is considerable, such as in direct plasma-assisted ALD. Another often neglected, but in many cases even more important, mechanism is defect creation by plasma radiation. As mentioned earlier, a significant amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is formed in plasmas, the energy of which can reach up to 10 eV (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). Oxides, such as SiO 2 as well as the high-k oxides, have band gap values smaller than 9 eV, meaning that vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation can create defects, for example, by photoemission or photoinjection of charge. Plasma-induced defect creation has been studied in great detail for the plasma processing of SiO 2 -based gate stacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">299,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">300,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b334">[346]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b335">[347]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b336">[348]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[349]</ref> and the influence of VUV exposure has also recently been studied for the high-k oxide HfO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">299,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">300,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b332">344,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b338">[350]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b339">[351]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b340">[352]</ref> However, this damage mechanism has not really been highlighted for plasma-assisted ALD processes, for example, during the synthesis of metal oxides by plasma-assisted ALD itself or when depositing other materials (such as electrode materials) on top of high-k oxides by plasma-assisted ALD. Note that, apart from the fact that the metal oxide film might itself be affected, the interfacial SiO x layer, which is typically present (either unintentionally or prepared on purpose) between the metal oxide and the Si substrate, can also be affected. From experiments (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14(a)</ref>), it has recently been demonstrated that the surface passivation of crystalline Si by as-deposited Al 2 O 3 is strongly affected by defects generated by VUV photons from the O 2 plasma (photon energy of 9.5 eV, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">303</ref> To illustrate that VUV radiation is responsible for the degradation in surface passivation, a silicon wafer coated with thermal ALD-deposited Al 2 O 3 (30 nm in thickness) was exposed to an O 2 plasma through 5.0 mm quartz and MgF 2 windows covering the sample which would either block or transmit the 9.5 eV photons, respectively. The results, which are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14(b</ref>), demonstrate that no degradation in lifetime is observed when the VUV radiation was blocked by the quartz window. However, for the exposure through the MgF 2 window, the lifetime degraded with a rate equal to that obtained when no window was used (after correcting for the $60% transmittance of the MgF 2 window at 130.5 nm wavelength). The photons emitted by the O 2 plasma during plasma-assisted ALD induce a very high interface defect density (D it % 10 12 eV À1 cm À2 at the midgap) such that extremely high surface recombination velocities of 10 7 cm/s were obtained. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">43</ref> However, most of these surface defects can be removed by annealing the films for 10 min at 400 C in N 2 (D it reduced to $10 11 eV À1 cm À2 ), such that excellent surface recombination velocities, as low as 1 cm/s, can be achieved on low-resistivity floatzone Si. These surface recombination velocities correspond to a surface passivation quality not yet paralleled by any other material. <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">323</ref> On the other hand, as-deposited Al 2 O 3 synthesized by thermal ALD affords reasonably low surface recombination velocities, as the films are not exposed to VUV radiation from a plasma (despite this fact, the level of surface passivation after annealing is not as good as for Al 2 O 3 synthesized with by plasma-assisted ALD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">43</ref> Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the level of surface passivation by asdeposited Al 2 O 3 synthesized by plasma-assisted ALD can be increased by decreasing the length of the plasma exposure 050801-16 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-16</p><p>step, in this case, by using slightly sub-saturated ALD conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">43</ref> The aforementioned challenges for plasma-assisted ALD are inherent to the plasma-surface interaction that takes place during the plasma step. To assess their possible impact on the potential applications of the plasma-assisted ALD method, a deeper investigation of the underlying surface processes, including the plasma-surface interaction, is required in order to establish whether they lead to problems for the specific applications considered. Another class of challenges is related to the development of equipment and the industrial scale-up of the process. The use of plasma steps during ALD cycles requires more complex equipment than that used for thermal ALD. Unless this additional complexity is compensated for by the significant advantages of plasma-assisted ALD, thermal ALD will be the method of choice. For research and development (R&amp;D), the interest in plasma-assisted ALD equipment is hardly or not affected, as R&amp;D equipment is required to directly compare the results obtained by plasma and thermal ALD. This is evidenced by the fact that several combined plasma and thermal ALD tools have recently been introduced onto the market. However, for industrial scale-up the situation is different. Here, plasma-assisted ALD will only be adopted when it provides major benefits over thermal ALD and when alternative deposition techniques are not available for the specific applications envisioned. The latter situation is currently prominent in the field of crystalline silicon photovoltaics, where mainly thermal ALD is currently considered by equipment manufacturers for the scale-up of Al 2 O 3 deposition, 18,353-355 despite the fact that plasma-assisted ALD can provide significant benefits over thermal ALD in this case. <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">356</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SELECTED APPLICATIONS</head><p>In the literature a number of applications have been suggested for thin films synthesized by plasma-assisted ALD. In the semiconductor industry these applications vary from the so-called "back-end-of-line," the level in IC fabrication where individual device components are interconnected, to the so-called "front-end-of-line," the level where the individual device components are created in and on the silicon substrate. Over the past few years, the application of the films as barrier and protective layers has gained significant interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Back-end-of-line processing</head><p>Although the first time that a plasma was used in an ALD process dates back to 1991, the research on plasma-assisted ALD primarily started around 2000, when major thin film challenges in the back-end-of-line processing were foreseen. At that time, the replacement of Al by Cu as the interconnect material was imminent and plasma-assisted ALD processes for the deposition of Ta and Ti liners were developed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">206</ref> Such liner materials became necessary to prevent Cu diffusion into the low-k dielectric and to promote the adhesion of Cu to the diffusion barrier layer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">357</ref> For this application, typically a stack of materials, such as TaN/Ta or TiN/Ti, needs to be employed and these materials need to be deposited in the trenches and vias before filling them with Cu. Therefore, in addition to the good barrier and adhesion properties, other requirements for the liner materials include a high conformality of the films in nanoscale structures, a deposition temperature compatible with back-end-of-line processing ( 400 C), as well as a high chemical and thermal stability. Also the resistivity should be low to keep the total resistance of the interconnects as low as possible and to allow for metal layers to be connected through the barrier layers. In particular cases, a low-resistivity barrier and adhesion layer could also simultaneously act as a seed-layer for the electrochemical deposition process of Cu. <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[180]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[181]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[182]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[183]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">220,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">240</ref> Triggered by these challenges, Rossnagel and co-workers at IBM developed plasma-assisted ALD processes of Ta and Ti using the metal halides TaCl 5 and TiCl 4 as precursors and an H 2 plasma as a reducing agent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">206</ref> As mentioned in Sec. IV, no thermal ALD processes exist for these metals, but the deposition of Ta and Ti films by plasma-assisted ALD was successful (see Fig. <ref type="figure">15</ref>). As a follow-up of this work, the IBM group, as well as others, also developed plasma-assisted ALD processes for other liner materials, including the metal-nitrides TaN and TiN. The development of these processes was intended to facilitate the switching from metal halide precursors to metal-organic precursors (e.g. Ta(NMe 2 ) 5 , Ta(N t Bu)(NEt 2 ) 3 , Ti(NMe 2 ) 4 to name a few) due to compatibility issues of the former, caused by halide impurities in the films. The plasmas employed were typically generated in H 2 , H 2 /N 2 and NH 3 . Research on a combined Cu diffusion barrier and Cu seed layer triggered the development of plasma-assisted processes of refractory metals, most prominently Ru, e.g. from Ru(Cp Et ) 2 as the precursor and an NH 3 plasma as the reactant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[165]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[166]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[167]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[168]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[169]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[170]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[171]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[172]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[173]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[174]</ref> A comprehensive overview of the metal and metal nitride films deposited by (plasma-assisted) ALD for Cu interconnect applications can be found in the review paper by Kim. 050801-17 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-17 JVST A -Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films</p><p>The suitability of plasma-assisted ALD-deposited Ta, TaN, Ti, and TiN films as diffusion barriers was investigated and reported in a number of articles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">175,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">204,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">219,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">222,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">225,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">226</ref> In an early report, Kim et al. demonstrated that the barrier films should preferably be amorphous, in order to avoid Cu leakage along the grain boundaries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">226,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b345">357</ref> They demonstrated that plasma-assisted ALD Ta films showed superior Cu diffusion barrier properties compared to their PVD counterpart, especially for thicknesses below 10 nm, due to the amorphous structure of the films. <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">204</ref> For TaN films deposited by plasma-assisted ALD and PVD, a similar performance was found with both materials basically showing the same barrier failure temperatures as a function of thickness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">219</ref> These results are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>. For a process involving the metal-organic precursor Ta(NMe 2 ) 5 and a N 2 plasma, it was demonstrated that TaN films of only 0.6 nm thick possessed a barrier failure temperature of &gt;800 C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">226</ref> This temperature is one of the higher values reported with the enhancement in diffusion barrier properties being mostly attributed to an increased nitrogen content in the film.</p><p>Another interesting issue addressed by Kim et al. is the fact that the barrier material should not penetrate into the porous low-k dielectric layer. Therefore, penetration of TaN during deposition with thermal and plasma-assisted ALD using Ta(NMe 2 ) 5 as the precursor and NH 3 or an H 2 /N 2 plasma as reactants was investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">357</ref> For the thermal ALD case, the TaN layer penetrated the porous dielectric material as both the precursor as the reactant species were able to enter the pores and participate in the ALD growth process. However, for the plasma-assisted case, no evidence of film growth was found deep in the pores. While the precursor is able to travel a significant distance into the pores, the plasma radicals cannot, as they will eventually recombine after undergoing several surface collisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">357</ref> Despite these efforts in the early 2000s, the interest and research on plasma-assisted (and thermal) ALD on liner materials declined after several years. The reason was that continuous improvements in PVD technology for Cu interconnects, for example by advances in ionized PVD, reduced the need for the adaption of a completely new film technology in the back-end-of-line processing. However, the research on ALD materials for back-end-of-line processing is currently increasing again, as it is inevitable that new thin film technologies will need to be implemented to deal with the challenges presented by future technology nodes. <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b345">357</ref> B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-k dielectric layers</head><p>Since the advent of Moore's law, the downscaling of CMOS transistors requires a continuous decrease in the thickness of the gate dielectric. By the end of the 1990s, it was realized that the required thickness of the standard SiO 2 layer would eventually be too thin to prevent large leakage currents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">358</ref> This led to an increase in interest, within the semiconductor industry, in ALD of dielectric thin films as a viable alternative to growing SiO 2 by thermal oxidation. It resulted in the screening of all kinds of high-k dielectrics, especially HfO 2 and ZrO 2 , and associated ALD processes to find a material with a physically higher thickness but a lower equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). Eventually it led to the implementation of Hfbased oxides deposited by ALD in the 45 nm technology node in 2007. 12, <ref type="bibr" target="#b347">359</ref> In addition to thermal ALD processes, it also resulted in many investigations of plasma-assisted ALD processes for high-k oxides, again putting a considerable effort into HfO 2 and related oxides. For example, Park et al. demonstrated that a plasma step can be beneficial as it can result in HfO 2 films with a higher density, a lower impurity level and a higher interface quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">135</ref> The films were deposited from Hf(NEtMe) 4 with an O 2 plasma as the reactant. Compared to thermally-deposited layers, the interface layer was thicker (2.0 nm versus 1.5 nm), but because it consisted of Hf-Si-O mixed with SiO 2 , the total film had a higher k-value than the thermal ALD layer with a SiO 2 interface layer. Moreover, the leakage current density of the plasma deposited samples was three times lower than that for the thermally-deposited samples, but the fixed oxide charge density was higher.</p><p>The fact that the availability of a plasma source also offers the possibility of using plasmas in situ before, during or after deposition was also exploited. In a number of studies, it was demonstrated that a thin SiO 2 layer grown by an O 2 plasma pretreatment can retard the formation of a Hf-silicate interface layer, resulting in films with improved k-values and related electrical properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">132</ref> The use of a CF 4 plasma for 60 s was also proven to be beneficial prior to the deposition process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">141</ref> Maeng et al. reported interface defect passivation by Si-F bonds resulting in a decrease in the flatband voltage and a lower leakage current density. The deposition of HfO 2 on a 1.0 nm thick plasma-nitrided HfO 2 or Al 2 O 3 layer was found to result in a thinner interfacial layer, a lower EOT, a lower leakage current density, and a reduced charge defect density. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">129</ref> Exploring variations in plasma composition, Lee et al. reported a lower fixed oxide charge density for HfO 2 when 050801-18 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-18 J.

Also, the growth per cycle was higher. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">134</ref> Maeng et al. also reported two different experiments in which a HfO x N y layer was incorporated within an HfO 2 film by varying the plasma composition during the ALD process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">143</ref> In this case the precursor was Hf(NMe 2 ) 4 , whereas the reactant was varied from an O 2 plasma to an H 2 plasma or an O 2 /N 2 plasma. The films possessed a higher k-value, a lower interface defect density D it and a lower or comparable leakage current density. The latter was attributed to the presence of N-H bonds, which block leakage paths and suppress conduction band lowering and reduce trap sites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">116</ref> Besides the plasma composition, the reactor choice can also influence the material properties, as already mentioned in Sec. V. Kim et al. reported polycrystalline HfO 2 films deposited from Hf(NEt 2 ) 4 and an O 2 plasma in a direct plasma reactor compared to amorphous films obtained with the same ALD chemistry in a remote plasma (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">17</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">125</ref> In addition to better dielectric properties, MOSFET devices that were prepared using remote-plasma ALD HfO 2 showed better interface properties and a lower fixed oxide charge density. The difference in material properties was attributed to the increased physical reactivity of the direct plasma, in terms of ion bombardment (see Sec. V). On the other hand, a beneficial effect of some (mild) ion bombardment was also demonstrated in a recent study. HfO 2 was deposited using Hf(NEtMe) 4 and an O 2 plasma in a capacitively-coupled remote plasma reactor (see Sec. III) in which the grid between the driven electrode and the substrate carrier was biased. Films deposited with a 30 W bias power resulted in films with a lower EOT and a higher breakdown electric field than those in an unbiased situation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">138</ref> Although the plasma-assisted ALD processes to Hf-based and the many other high-k oxides investigated are currently not considered for adaptation into process flows for advanced gate stacks, there are still many research efforts on plasma-assisted ALD of high-k oxides ongoing. Several other applications also exist for which high-k and other oxides deposited by plasma-assisted ALD are interesting candidates. In particular, the manufacture of high-density capacitors, for which ultrahigh-k oxides (e.g. SrTiO 3 (Refs.  195-198)) are being considered, 327 might require energyenhanced ALD processes as certain classes of precursors do not react with H 2 O under ALD conditions (see Sec.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spacer-defined double patterning</head><p>As discussed in the previous sections, plasma-assisted ALD is generally able to deposit thin films at lower temperatures than thermal ALD. In several cases, films of reasonably high quality can even be deposited at temperatures of 100 C and lower. This merit of plasma-assisted ALD has recently led to a development of high interest to the semiconductor industry. In order to keep up with the future demands of miniaturization, extreme-UV lithography (13.5 nm wavelength) is being developed. However, methods such as double exposure and double patterning <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">361,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b350">362</ref> are being adopted in the interim to extend the versatility of current lithography methods (193 nm wavelength) while still allowing for smaller structures to be defined. Recently an alternative form of double patterning, requiring only one lithography step instead of two, has been developed. This spaced-defined double-patterning method, which is currently being introduced in DRAM manufacturing for the fabrication of the next generation of logic devices, employs a low temperature plasma-assisted ALD step. <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b308">321,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b351">363</ref> In spacer-defined double patterning, a photoresist layer is deposited and patterned on top of the target layer, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">18</ref>. Then, a highly conformal SiO 2 spacer layer is deposited directly onto the photoresist pattern. This requires a low temperature plasma-assisted ALD process, as the photoresist is temperature-sensitive. Next, the structure is anisotropically etched and the photoresist is removed, resulting in a patterned layer with narrow spacer features. These then function as a mask for the second anisotropic etching step, in which the pattern is transferred to the target layer. Finally, the SiO 2 masking material can be removed. Obviously, the deposition of $20 nm thick SiO 2 layers with excellent uniformity and deposition temperatures &lt;100 C is key in this process. Plasma-assisted ALD is well-suited for this application and is, therefore, an enabling technology for the FIG. 17. Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of as-grown HfO 2 films deposited by (a) remote-plasma ALD and (b) direct-plasma ALD (Refs. 124, 125). The films were deposited on Si at a deposition temperature of 250 C using Hf(NEt 2 ) 4 as the precursor and an O 2 plasma as the reactant. A gradual transition from the interface layer to the HfO 2 layer can be observed for the remote-plasma ALD film, whereas the film deposited using a direct-plasma shows an abrupt transition. The film deposited using a direct-plasma was partially crystallized, whereas using a remote plasma afforded an amorphous film. 050801-19 Profijt et al.: Plasma-assisted ALD 050801-19 JVST A -Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films</p><p>spacer-defined double patterning method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Encapsulation</head><p>Another promising application of plasma-assisted ALD processes is the encapsulation of polymeric and/or organic devices by thin films. It has been demonstrated that metal oxide films (e.g. Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 ) prepared by plasmaassisted ALD can serve as good barrier layers against H 2 O and O 2 permeation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">251,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">256</ref> For Al 2 O 3 it was reported that the material can provide very low water vapor transmission rates for the encapsulation of organic LEDs while also significantly reducing the pinhole density. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">54</ref> The advantage of ALD processes for this application is that dense, high quality thin films can be prepared that outperform films prepared by other vapor phase deposition methods (such as PECVD and PVD) even when those layers are much thicker. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b352">364,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b353">365</ref> The main advantage of the plasma-based process is that short cycle times can be maintained at low substrate temperatures, including room temperature. Moreover, Langereis et al. reported the striking result that, for Al 2 O 3 films deposited by remote plasma-assisted ALD, the best barrier performance was obtained for films deposited at room temperature (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">19</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">54</ref> A related application of low temperature ALD-synthesized films is the protection of high-precision and high-purity metal parts against corrosion by water (liquid or vapor), acidic, basic or saline solutions, or organic solvents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">[366]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b355">[367]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b356">[368]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b357">[369]</ref> For this application, ultra-thin, dense, and defect-free coatings are also desired and, in most cases, they need to be deposited at reduced substrate temperatures to maintain the mechanical properties of the substrates and to reduce the possibility of premature surface oxidation. Al 2 O 3 is again among the most important candidate materials, although for the final application a stack of materials might be required. A recent study revealed that plasma-assisted ALD with an O 2 plasma produced Al 2 O 3 encapsulation layers that showed a better film nucleation and lower porosity than films deposited by thermal ALD using H 2 O vapor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">65</ref> For this application, but also for the application of Al 2 O 3 as an H 2 O and O 2 barrier, the advantage of plasma-assisted ALD over thermal ALD was most prominent for the thinnest films ($10 nm) deposited at room temperature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND OUTLOOK</head><p>With the growing need for high quality ultra-thin and conformal films, in and outside the semiconductor industry, the number of applications of ALD will grow substantially in the next decade. As a consequence, the requirements on process conditions and material properties will increase and diversify, requiring new experimental approaches and a variety of ALD equipment configurations. As plasma-assisted ALD can provide some unique merits over the thermal ALD method, it is expected that the interest in this method will also keep growing considerably. This increase in interest is already currently manifested by the number of ALD equipment manufacturers providing dedicated plasma-assisted ALD tools, which has increased significantly in the last few years. The demand for plasma-assisted ALD equipment from industrial R&amp;D laboratories has, in particular, appeared to be high. It is likely that this is fueled by the fact that industrial laboratories are particularly focused on equipment that provides a high degree of flexibility in combination with a robustness of the equipment and processes. In this respect, plasma-based techniques have been well-accepted in thin film and device manufacturing. Nevertheless, plasmaassisted ALD also faces several challenges. In order to address the question whether and when aspects inherent to the plasma-based process will provide principal limitations for certain applications, a deeper understanding of film growth by plasma-assisted ALD is required. Therefore, more insight into the underlying surface reactions and the role of the plasma-surface interaction needs to be obtained. This is quite a challenging task, but, consequently, also an appealing one considering the complexity of plasma processes. Also of vital importance is that plasma-assisted ALD equipment for high volume manufacturing will be developed and implemented. In the case where (multiple) single wafer reactors are used, the implementation of a plasma source is relatively easy. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Recently, however, the first results were presented on plasma-assisted ALD an inline spatial ALD system 66 while also the first results obtained in a multiwafer ALD batch reactor equipped with plasma source were presented. <ref type="bibr" target="#b358">370</ref> Furthermore, in 2007 a patent was filed on roll-to-roll ALD using an atmospheric plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b359">371</ref> by FujiFilm Manufacturing Europe. <ref type="bibr">372</ref> Generally for plasma-assisted ALD, it would be best to focus initially on applications for which no alternative deposition techniques exist, or on applications for which the merits of plasma-assisted ALD are substantial and critical. Once established, the method will certainly find more applications and plasma-assisted ALD will complement existing thin film manufacturing techniques.</p><p>International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, <ref type="url" target="http://www.itrs.net">http://www.itrs.  net</ref>, (May 31, 2011). 13 M.
