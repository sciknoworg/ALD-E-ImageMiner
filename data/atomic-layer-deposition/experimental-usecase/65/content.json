One method to deposit high- quality films with excellent control is atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, depositing  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  by ALD has turned out to be very challenging. In this work, it is shown that the plasma gas residence time  $\\tau$  is a key parameter for the deposition of  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  by plasma- assisted ALD and that this parameter can be linked to a so- called \"redeposition effect\". This previously ignored effect, which takes place during the plasma step, is the dissociation of reaction products in the plasma and the subsequent redeposition of reaction- product fragments on the surface. For  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  ALD using  $\\mathrm{SiH_2(NH^tBu)_2}$  as precursor and  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  plasma as reactant, the gas residence time  $\\tau$  was found to determine both  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  film quality and the resulting growth per cycle. It is shown that redeposition can be minimized by using a short residence time resulting in high- quality films with a high wet- etch resistance (i.e., a wet- etch rate of  $0.5\\mathrm{nm / min}$  in buffered HF solution). Due to the fundamental nature of the redeposition effect, it is expected to play a role in many more plasma- assisted ALD processes. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4926366]",

For this application, the requirement of uniform material quality and film thickness throughout the device, independent of transistor pitch, is becoming ever more rigorous as miniaturization of the transistor structures continues. One method to deposit high- quality thin films with excellent control is atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, despite the many advances in ALD, depositing  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  by ALD has turned out to be very challenging. $^{1 - 6}$  This is especially the case when low impurity levels and low wet- etch rates are required, combined with the need to be deposited at low substrate temperatures  $(< 400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  from halide- free precursors. $^{1}$  Similar as for other nitride ALD processes, plasmas can be used during the reactant step to increase the surface reactivity. $^{7}$  Nonetheless, even with the high reactivity of the plasma, long plasma times are required to avoid high impurity contents. Other process parameters which are generally identified as key for ALD of nitrides are the substrate temperature and the plasma gas pressure. $^{7}$  However, little is known about the underlying physical processes that determine the film quality. Hence, research efforts are carried out to identify the most important parameters and underlying processes and to find routes towards better nitride ALD processes.",

        "text": "The first indication of redeposition comes from the optical emission from the plasma during the ALD cycle. During the plasma step, the plasma not only consists of the feed gas but also of reaction products released from the surface. These reaction products will be dissociated in the plasma as long as they are present. This can be observed in Fig. 1(a) which shows that the plasma feedstock species yield a relatively constant emission signal while the signal from the dissociated reaction products (e.g., CN emission) is timedependent. The fragments of the reaction products can redeposit on the surface as illustrated by the schematic in Fig. 1(b). The time for interaction between the reaction products and the plasma depends on the gas residence time  $\\tau$  which is a measure of how long species remain in the reaction chamber before being flushed out. The residence time is given by the expression  $\\tau = V / q$  where  $V$  is the effective volume of the reactor and  $q$  is the volumetric flow rate through that volume (or effective pumping speed).10 The larger  $q$  ,the faster species are flushed out of the reactor. The presence of CN emission and also the presence of species, such as HCN,  $\\mathrm{C_3H_8}$  ,and  $\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{N}_2$  (not shown) as measured by mass spectrometry, show the interaction of the plasma with the reaction products and the formation of new species. Note that redeposition processes and removal of redeposition from the surface are continuous.

        "text": "To clearly demonstrate the presence of the redeposition effect, several experiments with different  $\\tau$  values but constant plasma exposure times were performed for the  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  ALD process. In these experiments,  $\\tau$  was varied by changing the total gas flow and the set pressure (controlled by the butterfly valve). High gas flows were achieved by adding Ar to the  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  plasma gas. A clear effect of redeposition is expected at  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  where a change in plasma pressure showed a large difference in refractive index as was shown in Table I. Figure 2(a) shows that for films deposited at  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  using  $10\\mathrm{s}$  plasma exposure and with various total gas flows and gas pressures, the refractive index increases with decreasing  $\\tau$ . Note that other effects associated with low pressure, such as a change in energy of ions impinging on the surface, appear secondary to the effect of low residence time and do not show a one- to- one influence on the refractive index. For instance, a pressure of 20 mTorr at a gas flow of 40 sccm leads to a lower refractive index than 40 mTorr at 100 sccm, even though the ion energies will be higher at 20 mTorr. Apparently, the ions, with energies estimated at  $< 15\\mathrm{eV}$  for the entire pressure range, have a much smaller effect than the residence time. A similar trend with  $\\tau$  can be observed for the impurity levels for films deposited at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  as shown in Fig. 2(b), even though the effect on refractive index is relatively small at this temperature (data not shown). Here, both the oxygen and carbon impurity levels decrease monotonically with decreasing  $\\tau$ , while the material properties do not show a clear dependence on pressure. Note that besides the faster removal of redepositing species at short  $\\tau$  values, also the faster removal of background impurities could contribute to lower oxygen levels. For instance, background water released from the reactor walls is removed faster at short  $\\tau$  values, leading to lower water levels during the plasma exposure. The improvement of the material quality at short  $\\tau$  values can have a direct influence on the application of these films. Figure 2(c) shows for instance that the wet- etch rates of the films correlate clearly with  $\\tau$ . The wet- etch rate is a key parameter for several applications of ALD  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  films including the application of  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  as spacer materials in transistors.",

When comparing curves for plasmas with different  $\\tau$  values, it becomes clear that the overshoot in GPC can be assigned to redeposition. The contribution by redeposition decreases when using lower  $\\tau$  values, and the effective rate of removal of the redeposition (the decrease of the GPC after the overshoot) is faster as well. The trend of the GPC with plasma exposure time can be fitted with a relatively simple two- term exponential decay function, $^{10}$  where the first part (A) of the function can be assigned to the normal ALD behavior during the plasma exposure step (i.e., creation of reactive sites for precursor adsorption), and the second part (B) of the function can be assigned to redeposition (i.e., the combined effect of redeposition of dissociated species and the subsequent removal again from the surface by the plasma). As expected, for lower  $\\tau$  values this component B is strongly reduced because less redeposition takes place under these conditions in the first place. When the GPC curves are fitted for three  $\\tau$  values, the resulting time constants can be plotted as a function of  $\\tau$  (Fig. 3(b)). The time constant of component A does not depend on  $\\tau$ , while the time constant of component B increases linearly with  $\\tau$ , which is directly in agreement with the mechanism illustrated by the schematic of Fig. 1(b). This means that the rate of the redeposition component scales with  $\\tau$ . The time constant of component A, in turn, purely depends on the flux of reactive species. Note that one has to consider changes in plasma parameters when varying the residence time. The fact that  $t_A$  is constant shows that our method of varying  $\\tau$  (adding gas and changing pumping speed) has minimal effect on initial saturation and therefore on the flux of reactive species. In general, the effect of  $\\tau$  on the GPC as function of plasma exposure shows that redeposition processes make the resulting film thickness more dependent on the received flux of reactive species. Therefore, even after initial saturation (described by component A), variations in flux over the wafer and in trench structures can have an effect on film uniformity and conformality due to redeposition.",

        "text": "In conclusion, redeposition has been identified as a key process for plasma- assisted ALD of  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  determining both the film growth and the material quality. Redeposition can be controlled by the gas residence time  $\\tau$  during the plasma step as it directly determines how fast the reaction products are flushed out of the reactor. The faster the reaction products are flushed out, the less chance they have that they redeposit on the surface. This will generally lead to higher film quality as shown by higher refractive index values and lower impurity levels. Consequently, for low  $\\tau$  values,  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  films with low wet- etch rates of  $0.5\\mathrm{nm / min}$  in buffered HF solution were obtained. Besides obtaining low  $\\tau$  values by only increasing the effective pumping speed, which would lead to low pressures,  $\\tau$  can also be relatively low even at moderate pressures when using high gas flows. These conditions could be favorable for sensitive devices where low pressure plasmas can lead to plasma damage due to ion bombardment or energetic plasma radiation. Since ligands are removed during the plasma step for basically all plasma- assisted ALD processes, the dissociation of these reaction products in the plasma and the subsequent redeposition could play a role in a wide range of ALD processes.",
