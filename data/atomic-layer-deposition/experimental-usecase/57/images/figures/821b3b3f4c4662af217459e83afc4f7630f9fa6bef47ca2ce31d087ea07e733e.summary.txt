The image displays the morphological changes of a film deposited at different temperatures using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the corresponding crystalline structure using X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The SEM images show the surface morphology of the films, while the XRD patterns reveal the crystallinity and phase transitions at various deposition temperatures.
