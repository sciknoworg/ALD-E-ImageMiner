        "text": "ABSTRACT: Cesium iodide (CsI) is a well- established scintillator material that also serves as a precursor for all- inorganic halide perovskite solar absorbers, such as  $\\mathrm{CsPbI}_3$  . However, the lack of conformal and scalable methods to deposit halide perovskite thin films remains a major challenge on their way to commercialization. In this work, we employ atomic layer deposition (ALD) as the key method due to its inherent scalability to large areas and complex- shaped surfaces. We demonstrate two new ALD processes for the deposition of CsI and  $\\mathrm{CsPbI}_3$  thin films. The CsI process relies on cesium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide  $(\\mathrm{Cs(btsa)})$  and tin(IV) iodide  $(\\mathrm{SnI}_4)$  as precursors and yields high- purity, uniform, and phase- pure thin films. This process works in a wide temperature range  $(140 - 350^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  and exhibits a large growth per cycle value (GPC) of  $3.3\\mathrm{\\AA}$ $85\\%$  of a CsI monolayer). Furthermore, we convert CsI into  $\\mathrm{CsPbI}_3$  perovskite by exposing a CsI film to our earlier  $\\mathrm{PbI}_2$  ALD process. We demonstrate the deposition of phase- pure  $\\gamma -$  or  $\\delta \\mathrm{- CsPbI}_3$  perovskite thin films, depending on the applied deposition temperature and number of  $\\mathrm{PbI}_2$  cycles. We believe that the ALD- based approach described in this work will offer a viable alternative for depositing perovskite thin films in applications that involve complex high aspect ratio structures or large substrate areas.",
