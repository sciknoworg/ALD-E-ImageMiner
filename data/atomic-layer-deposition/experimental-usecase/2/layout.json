The main difference to the conventional CVD is that in ALD the precursors are introduced to the reactor in alternate pulses that are separated by inert gas purging. The film growth proceeds in a layer- by- layer manner; that is, maximally one monolayer, but usually less, is formed during each growth cycle. The film growth is controlled by saturative precursor chemisorption on the growth surface or by saturative reactions of the precursor with reactive surface groups making the process self- limiting. As far as the surface saturation is achieved, the process is insensitive to small changes in the precursor doses, thus simplifying also the use of solid precursors. The thickness of the deposited films can be controlled accurately simply by the number of growth cycles applied."

Sufficient thermal stability is required for the ALD precursors since thermal decomposition of the precursors destroys the self- limiting growth mechanism. The physical state of the precursor, on the other hand, is not of great importance since also solid precursors can easily be used in ALD. Recently, we successfully deposited ruthenium thin films by ALD.18 The films showed excellent conformality and uniformity as characteristic to ALD. In that process the ligands of the ruthenium precursor were oxidatively decomposed by oxygen. In the present study, a similar process has been developed for deposition of platinum by ALD. In this paper we report the deposition of platinum from (methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum [MeCpPt- "
