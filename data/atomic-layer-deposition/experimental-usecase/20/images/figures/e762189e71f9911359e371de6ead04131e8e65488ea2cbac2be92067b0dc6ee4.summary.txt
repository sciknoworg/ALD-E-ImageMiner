The chart shows the intensity of counts per second for isotopes 48Ti, 6Li, and 138La at different depths (nm). The intensity for all isotopes remains relatively constant across the depth range shown, with slight variations observed between the two conditions labeled 'one lithium sub-cycle' and 'three lithium sub-cycles'.
