Studies on the growth of lanthanum titanates showed that the lanthanum deposition rate is reduced when the titanium oxide and lanthanum oxide processes are combined, leading to higher titanium contents in the films. The precursor systems used for deposition of lanthanum titanates were  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4 + }$  water and  $\\mathrm{La(thd)_3}$ $\\mathrm{thd} = 2,2,6,6$  - tetramethyl- 3,5- heptanedione)  $^+$  ozone.

The deposited films were analyzed by time- of- flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF- ERDA), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), X- ray fluorescence (XRF), X- ray reflectivity (XRR) and X- ray diffraction (XRD).

Crystalline LLT, having the perovskite structure  $\\mathrm{Li_2L_3O_{20}}$ $\\square_{\\mathrm{XO_2}}$ $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$ $0< x<$  0.16), has been reported to have a much higher bulk lithium ion conductivity than  $\\mathrm{LIPON^*}$  which leads to decreased internal resistance and thus increased performance of the batteries. The energy and power densities of the all- solid- state lithium ion batteries can be improved by moving from planar battery structures to three- dimensional structures.2 Fabrication of these three- dimensional structures sets special requirements for the thin film deposition techniques; the films need to be uniform both in thickness and composition across the three- dimensional surface structures. In addition, the films need to be pin hole free. Atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is a thin film deposition technique based on a self- limiting film growth mechanism, gives films with excellent conformality and uniformity. Therefore, ALD is a very promising technique for depositing thin films for three- dimensional all- solid- state lithium ion batteries.",

        "text": "There are reports on deposition of LLT by techniques such as sol- gel deposition, radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, electron beam evaporation and pulsed laser deposition (PLD).7,8,9 The sol- gel technique is not suitable for deposition of LLT into battery structures because it requires high- temperature annealing steps and readily produces porous films4 leading to decreased ionic conductivity of the films and risk for short circuits in the battery. Furusawa et al.5 reported difficulties in preparing LLT films by RF sputtering and focused instead on PLD. However, a drawback of the PLD technique is its limitation with substrate size. Tailoring the film composition is, in general, difficult when using the above mentioned vapor- phase methods, especially when taking into consideration the large difference in atomic mass of lithium compared to the other elements involved. For electron beam evaporation, some control of the film composition can be achieved by varying the electron beam power. However, all of these physical deposition techniques are unsuitable for deposition into complex three- dimensional structures.",

It may be explained by differences in the chemistry of the terminating surface after the preceding oxide sub- cycle which then leads to lower growth per cycle for one or both of the components when the processes are combined.

Pure lithium oxide films were first grown from  $\\mathrm{LiO'Bu}$  and water before the process was combined with the titanium oxide and lanthanum oxide processes. When three different binary processes are combined, the pulsing order of the sub- cycles may have an effect on the growth mechanism, especially if the precursors are of different chemical nature. In ALD, the chemical groups terminating the surface after each sub- cycle are important because they form the basis of the self- limiting growth and act as functional sites for reaction with the subsequent precursors. The influence of the pulsing order was studied by investigating two different pulsing sequences. In the first experiment (pulsing order 1) the  $\\mathrm{LiO'Bu + }$  water sub- cycle was introduced after the  $\\mathrm{La(thd)_3 + O_3}$  sub- cycle  $(\\mathrm{TiO_2 - La_2O_3 - Li_2O})$  and in the second experiment (pulsing order 2) it was introduced after the  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4 + H_2O}$  sub- cycle  $(\\mathrm{TiO_2 - Li_2O - La_2O_3})$ . The films deposited according to pulsing order 1 showed lower surface roughness and were more uniform than the films deposited according to pulsing order 2. The pulsing order 1 was therefore chosen for the remaining study. The pulsing order also affected the composition of the films where pulsing order 1 gave slightly lower lithium and slightly higher titanium content as measured by TOF- ERDA than the films deposited according to pulsing order 2. The carbon impurity content was also slightly higher in the films grown with pulsing order 2.",

Fig. 6 and 7 show SIMS intensity for the masses 6, 48, and 138 amu that correspond to  ${}^{6}\\mathrm{Li}$ ,  ${}^{48}\\mathrm{Ti}$ , and  ${}^{138}\\mathrm{La}$ , respectively. Due to lack of proper reference samples, absolute concentrations of the elements in the films cannot be determined from the SIMS analysis. Fig. 6 shows the signals for Li, Ti and La for LLT films grown with different  $\\mathrm{LiO}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{Bu}$  pulse times. It is evident that the intensity of the lithium signal for the films grown with a 2- s  $\\mathrm{LiO}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{Bu}$  pulse is lower than for films grown with an 8- s and a 12- s  $\\mathrm{LiO}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{Bu}$  pulse. This shows that a 2- s  $\\mathrm{LiO}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{Bu}$  pulse is insufficient to achieve saturation of the lithium content as also observed from the growth per cycle vs.  $\\mathrm{LiO}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{Bu}$  pulse time data (Fig. 5).",
