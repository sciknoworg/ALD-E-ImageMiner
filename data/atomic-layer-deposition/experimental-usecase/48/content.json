        "text": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of high- k dielectric materials has been a subject of intensive research over the past years. Among such high- k oxides, hafnium oxide  $\\mathrm{(HfO_2)}$  has been endorsed largely for the application of high- k gate oxide in complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices owing to its high permittivity, fairly large band gap, and ability to form a thermodynamically stable interface with Si. The application of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  as a gate oxide material is not only limited to conventional Si based devices but also extending its horizons in novel nanomaterials based devices. For instance, Radisavljevic et al. have recently shown that by implementing  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  as gate oxide for a field effect transistor device based on an emerging 2D- nanomaterial, molybdenum disulphide  $(\\mathrm{MoS}_2)$ , the mobility could be drastically boosted owing to the suppression of coulombic scattering via dielectric screening. Furthermore, most recently, the application of a gate stack based on  $\\mathrm{HfO_2 / Al_2O_3 / }$  III- V  $\\mathrm{In}_{0.53}\\mathrm{Ga}_{0.47}\\mathrm{As}$  for metal- oxide- semiconductor capacitor devices has been demonstrated by Djara et al. These devices have a  $\\mathrm{HfO_2 / Al_2O_3}$  stack as gate oxide deposited by plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD) and show a low interface trap density  $(D_{it})$ . Additionally,  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  also finds applications as a protective coating for microelectromechanical systems and as insulator for organic devices such as organic light emitting diode and organic field effect transistors.",

This hypothesis was confirmed by the elemental composition analysis carried out by XPS and RBS as reported in Table II.

        "text": "In this study, a plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition process for the deposition of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  thin films using a hafnium precursor  $\\mathrm{[HfCp(NMe_2)_3]}$  comprising cyclopentadienylalkylamido ligands in combination with  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma has been evaluated. The growth characteristics clearly show the high thermal stability and high growth rate of the used precursor combined with  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma yielding a high GPC value of  $\\sim 1.1\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle over a wide ALD temperature range of  $150–400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . High purity  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  thin films were obtained even at fairly low deposition temperatures with carbon and hydrogen residual impurity contents below 2 and 3.5 at.  $\\%$  , respectively, for the whole range of substrate stage temperature investigated. A high substrate stage temperature of  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  resulted in fully crystalline, predominantly monoclinic as- deposited  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  thin films with a high refractive index and a smooth surface. It was also found that the  $\\mathrm{HfCp(NMe_2)_3}$  in combination with  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma requires shorter ALD cycle time relatively as compared to the ALD process using  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as oxidizing agent and therefore the plasma- enhanced ALD process offers a promising and viable method complementary to the thermal ALD process for producing high quality  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  thin films.",
