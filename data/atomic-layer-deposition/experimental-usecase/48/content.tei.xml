<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of high-k dielectric materials has been a subject of intensive research over the past years. Among such high-k oxides, hafnium oxide (HfO 2 ) has been endorsed largely for the application of high-k gate oxide in complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices owing to its high permittivity, fairly large band gap, and ability to form a thermodynamically stable interface with Si. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> The application of HfO 2 as a gate oxide material is not only limited to conventional Si based devices but also extending its horizons in novel nanomaterials based devices. For instance, Radisavljevic et al. have recently shown that by implementing HfO 2 as gate oxide for a field effect transistor device based on an emerging 2Dnanomaterial, molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2 ), the mobility could be drastically boosted owing to the suppression of coulombic scattering via dielectric screening. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Furthermore, most recently, the application of a gate stack based on HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 / III-V(In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As) for metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor devices has been demonstrated by Djara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> These devices have a HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 stack as gate oxide deposited by plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD) and show a low interface trap density (D it ). Additionally, HfO 2 also finds applications as a protective coating for microelectromechanical systems and as insulator for organic devices such as organic light emitting diode and organic field effect transistors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> ALD has been the method of choice for depositing thin films of HfO 2 . The self-saturating nature of the ALD process enables atomic level control over thickness and uniformity and this makes ALD ideal for preparing ultrathin HfO 2 thin films. In particular, the much needed conformality over high aspect ratio structures in combination with the excellent uniformity over large surface areas and the pin-hole free nature of the ALD produced thin films makes ALD a befitting deposition process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> In ALD, the choice of precursor has a large effect on the quality and properties of the deposited thin films. This leads to a continuous effort in precursor synthesis aiming at improving temperature stability and/or reducing impurity concentrations in the resulting film depending on the final application. In literature, a number of Hf precursors have been implemented for HfO 2 ALD processes. The established ALD processes leave a room for improvement in terms of extension of operating conditions. In this contribution, we have investigated a novel precursor, HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 , in combination with O 2 plasma which has yielded into a viable HfO 2 ALD process with a constant growth rate over the widest possible range of operating conditions such that it is suited for a multitude of applications. The details of the process investigated will be discussed in this paper. However, it is useful to systematically look at established ALD processes as listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, where a brief overview of efforts reported in literature focusing on detailed investigation of the ALD processes by using four different precursor groups for HfO 2 thin films is given. The most frequently used precursor for HfO 2 ALD is HfCl 4 which is combined with H 2 O or O 3 as oxygen source. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> However, the limitations associated with this precursor, such as corrosive byproducts and poor nucleation on H-terminated Si at high temperatures (!300 C), make this precursor unfavorable for some specific applications like dynamic random-access memories and therefore have led for a search for alternative precursor chemistries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> One of such a widely applied alternative precursor group for HfO 2 ALD is alkylamide comprising metal-nitrogen bonds, namely Hf(NEtMe) 4 (TEMAH), Hf(NEt 2 ) 4 , and Hf(NMe 2 ) 4 (Et ¼ C 2 H 5 , Me ¼ CH 3 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> These alkylamide type precursors possess a high volatility and reactivity and yield a high growth per cycle (GPC) in combination with H 2 O or O 3 as coreactants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> However, they suffer from a limited thermal stability which can lead to a parasitic CVD component and might result into high impurity concentrations and poor film uniformity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> In addition, Kukli et al. have demonstrated that the HfO 2 ALD process using TEMAH in combination with H 2 O as oxygen source leads to an increment in GPC from 0.9 A ˚/cycle at 250 C to 1.5 A ˚/ cycle at 325 C, indicating the decomposition of the precursor at temperatures !300 C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> To overcome this, an ALD process using the cyclopentadienyl (Cp ¼ C 5 H 5 ) precursor type was investigated. A higher thermal stability was achieved and ALD saturation was realized at a relative high substrate temperature of 400 C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> However, a lower GPC of $0.5 A ˚/cycle was obtained when using Cp-precursors like (CpMe) 2 HfMe 2 and (CpMe) 2 Hf(OMe)Me as compared to the alkylamides ($0.9 A ˚/cycle). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> With the aim of combining the benefits of both precursor types, precursors comprising both cyclopentadienyl and alkylamide type ligands have been investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> A high thermal stability and high GPC attributed to cyclopentadienyl ligands and alkylamide ligands, respectively, have been demonstrated for both Hf and Zr based ALD processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> For ZrO 2 , this combined merit of high thermal stability and high growth per cycle has been manifested by using a chemically analogous precursor, i.e., CpZr(NMe 2 ) 3 in combination with H 2 O, where a growth per cycle of 0.8-1 A ˚/cycle in the temperature range of 120-350 C was obtained. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> However, a similar Hf precursor containing mixed cyclopentadienyl and alkylamide ligands, i.e., HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 when applied in combination with H 2 O yielded a growth per cycle of only 0.23-0.36 A ˚/cycle in the temperature range of 305-375 C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Furthermore, Niinist€ o et al. have shown that the use of a stronger oxidant like O 3 in combination with HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 yields a higher growth per cycle (0.75 A ˚/cycle) in the temperature range of 250-350 C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The higher growth in the latter case might be attributed to the high reactivity of O 3 at a relatively low temperature resulting in the efficient removal of the bulky Cp ligands. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> However, both with H 2 O or O 3 as oxidizing agents, depositions have not been reported below 250 C, which might be necessary for HfO 2 film deposition on temperature-sensitive substrates, in particular, for organic device applications and flexible electronics based on novel nanomaterials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> In this context, another alternative is to employ a plasma enhanced ALD process (i.e., O 2 plasma as oxygen source) in combination with the same Hf precursor [HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 ] for growth of HfO 2 thin films. It is well known that the use of plasma chemistry offers potential advantages like improved material properties, feasibility of lower deposition temperatures, and increased flexibility in process conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> In the present study, we report the HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 in combination with an O 2 plasma process which yields a fairly high growth per cycle over a wide ALD temperature window (150-400 C) while retaining the high material properties. A detailed characterization of the HfO 2 PEALD process has been carried out. The dependence of film growth rate on various parameters like growth temperature and duration of dose during the plasma enhanced ALD process has been studied. Furthermore, an elaborated material characterization elucidating the film structure and composition depending on growth temperature has been performed. Finally, in order to assert the potential of ALD to deposit conformally on 3D structures, the film conformality over high aspect ratio structures has also been demonstrated.</p><p>TABLE I.

Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 35, No. 1, Jan/Feb 2017 II. EXPERIMENT A. Film deposition</p><p>The HfO 2 thin films were deposited in an Oxford Instruments FlexAL TM ALD reactor on 100-200 mm Si wafers either with a native oxide layer or H-terminated as created by a hydrofluoric acid (HF)-last process (1% HF). The Hf precursor employed was HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 , HyALD TM , obtained from AirLiquide. The precursor was stored in a stainless steel canister and heated to 60 C. At this temperature, the vapor pressure of the HyALD precursor is approximately 100 mTorr. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> For the precursor delivery to the deposition chamber a 100 sccm Ar (&gt;99.999% purity) bubbling flow was employed. An Ar purge step with 100 sccm of Ar flow was applied after the precursor and plasma exposure steps. To avoid condensation of the precursor, the delivery lines were kept at 90 C while the reactor walls were heated to 120 C. As the oxidizing agent, an O 2 (&gt;99.999% purity) plasma generated in an inductively coupled plasma source was used. The reactor pressure during the plasma step was 15 mTorr. The plasma power used was 400 W. The substrate stage was heated to temperatures in the range of 150-400 C during the deposition processes. It is worth mentioning that there was a $20%-25% difference between the set temperature value and the actual substrate temperature for the reactor employed in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Film analysis</head><p>The thickness and the optical properties of the HfO 2 thin films were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Ex situ measurements (J.A. Woollam M2000D) were performed to determine the final thickness and the dielectric function in the 1.25-6.5 eV spectral range. The film thickness evolution during deposition was monitored by in situ measurements (J.A. Woollam M2000F, 1.25-5 eV).</p><p>To determine the elemental composition and the density of the films Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) was used. Furthermore, elastic recoil detection (ERD) was employed to determine the hydrogen content in the films. Both RBS and ERD were performed using a 2 MeV 4 He þ ion flux (Acctec BV, The Netherlands). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also performed using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha spectrometer using monochromatic Al Ka x-ray radiation (h ¼ 1486.6 eV). XPS was used to quantify C and N contaminations in the films due to the higher sensitivity of XPS compared to RBS for these elements. For the XPS analysis, a 400 lm diameter spot was used, and photoelectrons were collected at a take-off angle of 60 . The samples were neutralized during the XPS analysis using an electron flood gun in order to correct for differential or nonuniform charging.</p><p>Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) was employed to determine the crystalline phases of the HfO 2 thin films. The XRD analysis was performed on a Panalytical X'Pert PRO MRD employing Cu Ka (1.54 A ˚) radiation with an incidence angle of 0.5 with respect to the substrate plane. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the films. The AFM scans were performed in tapping mode with a NT-MDT Solver P47 microscope using a TiN coated Si tip (NSG10/TiN, NT-MDT). Cross-sectional TEM analysis was performed using a JEOL ARM 200 operated at 200 kV. For this, the HfO 2 film was coated with a SiO x /Pt film stack as a protective layer and subsequently prepared using a standard FIB lift-out TEM sample preparation scheme.</p><p>The conformality of HfO 2 ALD process was determined on substrate coupons with high-aspect-ratio (HAR) nanostructures. These HAR nanostructures were created by etching SiO 2 grown by PECVD into the Si wafer. The SiO 2 nanostructures were then coated with a SiNx layer deposited by high-temperature CVD, onto which a SiO 2 thin film was deposited using ALD. The HfO 2 sample was coated with a layer of spin-on epoxy to fill the remaining gaps in the trenches in order to protect the film from curtaining damage during the subsequent lift-out FIB sample preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. ALD growth</head><p>The ALD process was characterized by monitoring the GPC by in situ SE analysis. The influence of dose steps was investigated by varying the duration of the precursor step, the O 2 plasma step and the purge steps between each half cycle. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1(a</ref> . Also, when no purge step was applied after the precursor dose step, the GPC value did not show a remarkable change. By supplying O 2 during all ALD steps, including the precursor dose, it was verified that the HyALD precursor does not react with the molecular oxygen in the process space investigated, thus excluding the presence of a parasitic CVD component.</p><p>The duration of the purge step applied after the plasma step showed however an influence on the growth, in particular a higher GPC was recorded with a decreasing purge time. This is likely caused due to a parasitic CVD growth component due to chemical reactions between the byproducts after the plasma step (i.e., H 2 O) and the HyALD precursor when low purge times are employed. On the basis of the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, to guarantee a genuine saturation behavior of precursor and purge steps, a precursor/purge/ plasma/purge sequence of 5/2/8/5 s was chosen in this work.</p><p>The influence of the substrate temperature on the GPC was also determined. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) shows the thickness evolution of HfO 2 films deposited at substrate stage temperatures ranging between 150 and 400 C as obtained from in situ SE. For all temperatures studied, the films showed a linear growth trend without growth delay as expected for a typical O 2 plasma ALD process. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> GPC values as calculated from Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a), corresponding to the studied substrate stage temperatures and the average number of Hf atoms deposited per ALD cycle as determined from RBS measurements. As mentioned above, the high thermal stability of HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 allows to explore a larger temperature window. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The GPC value remains constant at around 1.1 A ˚/cycle for the whole range of substrate stage temperatures from 150-400 C signifying the decomposition-free deposition. The relatively higher GPC value at low temperatures (150-200 C) can be attributed to a higher incorporation of impurities combined with a lower density of the films for lower deposition temperatures. This hypothesis was confirmed by the elemental composition analysis carried out by XPS and RBS as reported in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. The film densities were obtained through the combined RBS and SE analysis, and the stoichiometric ratios for Hf/O were determined from the RBS areal density values for Hf and O, respectively. As reported in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, the Hf/O ratio increased with increasing deposition temperature and an excellent stoichiometric value close to $0.5 was achieved at 400 C. The over-stoichiometric films (i.e., oxygen rich) obtained at lower deposition temperatures might be attributed to the formation of hydroxyl impurities. The hydroxyl impurities are directly related to the H content which decreased with the increasing deposition temperature. Furthermore, the N and C levels were below 1 and 2 at. % irrespective of the deposition temperature. The corresponding XPS depth profile spectra for the films deposited at the substrate stage temperature of 400 C are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> of the supplementary material. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> The low N and C levels obtained are a clear merit, as in earlier work the performance of devices with HfO 2 has clearly shown to degrade with increasing impurity levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Moreover, as will be shown in Sec. III B, the degree of crystallinity increases for higher deposition temperatures. FIG. 2. (Color online) (a) Film thickness as a function of number of ALD cycles with temperature ranging between 150 and 400 C. The thickness values have been obtained from in situ SE. (b) GPC values corresponding to the studied substrate stage temperatures and the average number of Hf atoms deposited per ALD cycle as determined from RBS measurements. 01B130-4 Sharma et al.: Atomic layer deposition of HfO 2 01B130-4</p><p>As mentioned above, the GPC obtained in this work (1.1 A ˚/cycle) is considerably higher than the previously reported values in the literature when using HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 in combination with H 2 O (0.23-0.36 A ˚/cycle) or O 3 (0.75 A ˚/ cycle) as oxidizing agents. This can likely be attributed to the creation of a higher density of reactive surface sites for precursor adsorption owing to the higher reactivity of plasma species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> It is also worth mentioning that the usage of plasma species leads to reduction in purge time resulting in shorter cycle times, which impact the overall ALD process throughput. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> This is corroborated by the fact that HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 in combination with H 2 O requires a long post-H 2 O purge time (30 s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> as compared to post-O 2 plasma purge time (5 s) in this work which therefore increases the net ALD throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Optoelectronic properties and crystallinity</head><p>The optical properties of HfO 2 films have been analyzed by ex situ SE. Cauchy and B-spline models were used for obtaining the dielectric functions in the fully transparent and absorbing regions, respectively. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the dielectric function, i.e., the real (e 1 ) and imaginary part (e 2 ), of $32 nm HfO 2 films deposited in the temperature range studied. The imaginary part of dielectric function was used to determine the Tauc band gap by plotting (e 2 E 2 ) 1/2 as a function of photon energy and extrapolating the linear part to zero absorption. The resulting band gap values obtained by this procedure is listed in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, and a Tauc plot corresponding to the film deposited at a substrate stage temperature of 400 C is shown in the supplementary material (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). As evident in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the films deposited at higher temperatures have the higher values of e 1 in the regions with e 2 ¼ 0. The higher value of e 1 corresponds to a higher refractive index and is consistent with the elemental analysis: less impurities and a higher density for thin films deposited at high temperatures. Furthermore, the dielectric function of the film deposited at 400 C shows distinctive sharp features, both in e 1 and e 2 , compared to the other films. These features can be imputed to a polycrystalline nature of the film leading to sharper electronic transitions. An onset from a smooth dielectric function (&lt;300 C) to one with sharper features (400 C) for the film deposited at 350 C is visible in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>These findings were corroborated by GI-XRD analysis of the same films as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The GI-XRD spectra of the film deposited at 200 C showed no distinctive diffraction peaks, and only a broad peak at 2⍜ $ 32 was detected corresponding to amorphous HfO 2 . The film deposited at 300 C also showed a broad peak at 2⍜ $ 32 while a broad diffraction peak with weak intensity, corresponding to the (111) peak of the monoclinic phase, could be detected. This indicates that the HfO 2 thin films studied were mostly amorphous for deposition temperatures up to 300 C. When increasing the deposition temperature to 350 C, a clear transition in the GI-XRD spectra could be seen. Diffraction peaks corresponding to the monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic HfO 2 phases were detected, indicating a higher degree of crystallinity as compared to lower deposition temperatures of 200 and 300 C. By further increasing the substrate stage temperature to 400 C, peaks having higher intensity were measured indicating a higher degree of crystallinity. The monoclinic phase appeared to be dominant at this deposition temperature.</p><p>TABLE II. Elemental composition of HfO 2 films as determined by RBS, ERD and XPS.

In their work, Niinist€ o et al. showed a similar temperature dependence of the HfO 2 film crystallinity with a clear transition from amorphous to crystalline films at a deposition temperature of 300 C. The difference in temperature between this work and the one reported by Niinist€ o et al. at which this transition could be observed is imputed to a $20%-25% difference between the set stage temperature value and the actual substrate temperature for the reactor employed in this work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> It can be concluded that the crystallization temperature of HfO 2 films is rather independent of the oxygen source used in combination with HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 during the ALD process. However, the usage of a plasma-assisted ALD process may open the possibility for tuning of the crystalline phase by ion bombardment by employing substrate biasing during processing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> which is the object of further investigation.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows a cross-sectional TEM image of a $32 nm HfO 2 film deposited at 400 C on H-terminated Si substrate.

On the basis of the obtained morphology, it can be argued that the singular features observed might be associated with the increasing degree of crystallinity with the increase in deposition temperature from 200 to 350 C resulting in a transition from amorphous to polycrystalline films as shown before in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">4</ref> corresponding to the SE and GI-XRD analyses. Furthermore, the lower RMS roughness value obtained at 400 C might be attributed to the full crystallization obtained already during the deposition process leading to a laterally homogeneous and smooth HfO 2 thin film, which is also supported by TEM image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</p><p>This effect was also confirmed for thicker films as depicted in Figs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this study, a plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition process for the deposition of HfO 2 thin films using a hafnium precursor [HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 ] comprising cyclopentadienylalkylamido ligands in combination with O 2 plasma has been evaluated. The growth characteristics clearly show the high thermal stability and high growth rate of the used precursor combined with O 2 plasma yielding a high GPC value of $1.1 A ˚/cycle over a wide ALD temperature range of 150-400 C. High purity HfO 2 thin films were obtained even at fairly low deposition temperatures with carbon and hydrogen residual impurity contents below 2 and 3.5 at. %, respectively, for the whole range of substrate stage temperature investigated. A high substrate stage temperature of 400 C resulted in fully crystalline, predominantly monoclinic as-deposited HfO 2 thin films with a high refractive index and a smooth surface. It was also found that the HfCp(NMe 2 ) 3 in combination with O 2 plasma requires shorter ALD cycle time relatively as compared to the ALD process using H 2 O as oxidizing agent and therefore the plasma-enhanced ALD process offers a promising and viable method complementary to the thermal ALD process for producing high quality HfO 2 thin films.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>)-1(d) show the GPC values obtained at a substrate temperature of 250 C when varying the HyALD and O 2 plasma exposure steps [Figs. 1(a) and 1(c), respectively], and purge times after the precursor dose and the plasma exposure step [Figs. 1(b) and 1(d), respectively]. The GPC showed a clear saturation behavior for both the precursor and the plasma half cycles resulting in a GPC value of $1.1 A ˚/cycle.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><figDesc>5(b) reveals the presence of an amorphous SiO 2 layer at the Si/HfO 2 interface. The amorphous nature of the Si substrate is imputed to damage caused by the focused ion beam used during sample preparation. The TEM image shows that the HfO 2 film is fully crystalline which is in line with the GI-XRD analysis. Furthermore, individual HfO 2 grains can be identified [Fig. 5(b)] with an average lateral grain size of $20-30 nm. C. Surface morphology The AFM scans over an area of 500 Â 500 nm 2 for the $32 nm thick HfO 2 films (300 ALD cycles) deposited at 200, 300, 350, and 400 C are depicted in Figs. 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), and 6(d), respectively. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values obtained from 2 Â 2 lm 2 AFM scans of the same samples are indicated in Figs. 6(a)-6(d). For the film deposited at 200 C, a very smooth surface (RMS ¼ 1.29 nm) with very few randomly distributed singular features was obtained [see Fig. 6(a)]. The higher substrate stage temperature of 300 and 350 C yielded an increase in density and size of these singular features as depicted in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c). The RMS roughness values also showed an increment with increasing deposition temperature from 200 to 350 C. AFM scans of the HfO 2 sample deposited at 400 C revealed a slightly different film morphology with a decreased RMS roughness value compared to the film deposited at 350 C [Fig.</figDesc></figure>

The RMS roughness values of these two films are also indicated in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f). The increase in RMS as a function of layer thickness of the samples grown at 400 C can be explained by grain coarsening, i.e., increase in (lateral) grain size as a function of film height. The film deposited at 250 C shows higher surface roughness compared to the one deposited at 400 C, most likely because of coalescence of individual crystalline grains at 400 C in the top part of the layer.</figDesc></figure>
