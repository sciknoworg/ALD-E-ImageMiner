Unique to ALD is that precursor vapors are brought onto the substrates alternately, one at a time, separated by purging periods with inert gas. The film grows via saturative surface reactions between the incoming precursor and the surface species left from the previous precursor. When all the reactions are saturative and no precursor decomposition takes place, the film growth is self- limiting providing a number of attractive features, such as easy and accurate film thickness control down to an atomic layer level, excellent large area uniformity, and unrivaled conformality on complex- shaped substrates."

Reaching the self- limiting growth conditions places strict demands on the precursors. Besides volatile, they should be thermally stable against self- decomposition but at the same time also show high reactivity toward surface species formed by the other precursor. As decomposition cannot be exploited for the ligand elimination, the precursors must be chosen so that the ligands will be effectively eliminated by exchange reactions. Considering nonmetals, and the group 16 elements in particular, hydrides are often an ideal choice as they allow clean ligand elimination by protonation. However, hydrides of many nonmetals are highly toxic. In group 16 water of course is without this concern, and "
