<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of titanium dioxide from TiCl 4 and H 2 O was studied at substrate temperatures of 100± 4008C. Using a real-time quartz crystal microbalance method, it was demonstrated that although the surface reactions were self-limited, the growth rate depended on the temperature and development of the thin ®lm structure. Relatively low growth rate which was obtained in the TiCl 4 /H 2 O ALD process, was found to be a result of a signi®cant chlorine amount adsorbed during the TiCl 4 pulse. Surface intermediates formed in the initial stage of TiCl 4 adsorption were unstable and weakly bonded to the surface. Desorption and decomposition of these species additionally in¯uenced the deposition rate and, especially, its dependence on the precursor pulse times.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Self-controlled thin ®lm deposition methods, known as atomic layer epitaxy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, molecular layer epitaxy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, molecular layering <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, atomic layer deposition (ALD) [5±7], etc., allow reproducible growth of thin and ultra-thin ®lms. A speci®c feature of these methods is that a thin ®lm is formed as a result of repeated deposition cycles. At least two subsequent self-limited surface reactions are used to form a new layer of the ®lm material in each cycle. In most applications, the precursors reacting with the surface are adsorbed from molecular beams <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or from the gas phase (e.g. <ref type="bibr">[2,5±7]</ref>). The growth rate can reach one monomolecular layer of the ®lm material per deposition cycle but usually it is signi®cantly lower, especially when compounds with large ligands are used as the precursors. A common reason for reduced growth rate is that a precursor molecule temporarily blocks several adsorption sites while the constituent of the ®lm material occupies only one or few of those. Naturally, higher growth rates should be obtained when using precursors with smaller ligands. However, in some cases this general rule does not apply. For instance, in the process where TiCl 4 and H 2 O or H 2 O 2 are used as the precursors to grow titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), typical growth rates have ranged from 0.04 to 0.07 nm per cycle at substrate temperatures of 150± 4008C <ref type="bibr">[2,5±8]</ref>. Rather similar or even higher growth rates can be obtained when using organic precursors such as titanium ethoxide (Ti(OCH 2 CH 3 ) 4 ) and titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 ) having remarkably larger sizes of ligands. At temperatures 150±2508C, the growth rates of 0.05±0.15 nm per cycle have been obtained in the ALD process where titanium isopropoxide and H 2 O or H 2 O 2 were used as the precursors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In case of titanium ethoxide and H 2 O, the growth rate reached 0.06±0.08 nm per cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The effective diameters of the TiCl 4 , Ti(OCH 2 CH 3 ) 4 and Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 molecules have been estimated to be 0.64, 0.78 and 0.88 nm, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Correspondingly, the theoretical limits of the growth rate are 0.099, 0.067 and 0.052 nm per cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, provided that no exchange reactions take place during adsorption of these titanium precursors. Of course, exchange reactions that might appear during adsorption of the precursors could reduce the size of adsorbed species. In this way, larger amounts of precursors can be adsorbed and higher growth rates become possible. When growing metal oxides in a process, in which H 2 O or H 2 O 2 is used as an oxygen precursor, hydroxyl groups can be formed on the surface during the oxygen precursor pulse. Thus, the metal precursor adsorbed may react with surface hydroxyl groups and release some ligands in this reaction. It has been shown that at 200±2508C, in average 2.2±2.9 ligands are released from each Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 molecule in the Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 /H 2 O and Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 /H 2 O 2 processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Signi®cant ligand release from adsorbed Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 molecules explains why the experimental values of growth rate are sometimes remarkably higher than those estimated from the Ti(OCH(CH 3 ) 2 ) 4 molecule size. In the Ti(OCH 2 -CH 3 ) 4 /H 2 O process, by contrast, the average number of ligands released from an adsorbing molecule does not exceed 1.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and the growth rate is comparable to the estimation given above <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Haukka et al. [13±16]</ref> have shown that the exchange reactions with hydroxyl groups also contribute to TiCl 4 /H 2 O process, at least when growing TiO 2 on silica catalysts. These authors have concluded that each TiCl 4 molecule reacts with one to two hydroxyl groups and as a result up to two chlorine ligands are released from an adsorbed TiCl 4 molecule. In this context, however, it is not clear why the experimen-tally obtained growth rates of the thin ®lms are up to two times lower than the theoretical value calculated for the process, in which no ligands are released from adsorbed TiCl 4 . It has been discussed that HCl, which is released in the reaction between TiCl 4 and surface hydroxyl groups, may re-adsorb and occupy adsorption sites for TiCl 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Another possibility is that the exchange reactions, which do contribute to the growth on silica catalysts, are hindered in case of planar substrates. This may be due to different structure of substrates and/or growing ®lm. Indeed, formation of surface hydroxyl groups on crystalline oxides might depend, for instance, on the structure type and crystalline plane, which is exposed to water vapor. Therefore, it would not be surprising if the growth mechanism was dependent on the structure development as well. In order to lighten these problems, we performed the study described below. The work was aimed at better understanding the reaction mechanisms in the TiCl 4 /H 2 O process and revealing the reasons for rather limited growth rate on planar substrates in ¯ow-type ALD reactors.</p><p>Unfortunately, the choice of methods for surface studies in this kind of reactors is limited. For instance, electron spectroscopy methods, such as Auger electron spectroscopy etc. cannot be applied because the surface intermediate species formed in the growth process are unlikely so stable that they would save their characteristics during transportation of the substrates from the growth reactor to an ultra-high vacuum analysis chamber. At the same time, the infrared spectroscopy method that has been used in case of porous silica catalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> is not suf®ciently sensitive to record the surface species on planar substrates. For this reason, the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> was applied to investigate the deposition kinetics in real-time and reveal the most probable reaction mechanisms. The same technique was used to study the reactions of HCl with hydroxylated TiO 2 surface and the effect of crystal structure development on the growth process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental</head><p>The thin ®lms were grown in a low pressure ¯owtype ALD reactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Each of the periodically repeated growth cycles included a TiCl 4 pulse, purge time, H 2 O pulse and another purge time. The vapors of TiCl 4 and H 2 O were carried into the reaction zone in the ¯ow of pure (99.999%) nitrogen gas. During the purge times, only the carrier gas was led through the reactor. The process was carried out at the pressure of 250 Pa.</p><p>QCM working at the oscillation frequency of 30 MHz was applied to record the deposition kinetics in real-time. In the real-time measurements, the thin ®lm was deposited on the mass sensor of QCM while the mass changes were recorded with sampling period of 0.5 s. To reduce the effect of the mass sensor on the growth process, a buffer layer of TiO 2 was deposited on the sensor crystal before starting the measurements. Buffer layers grown at different temperatures, T B , allowed us to vary the structure of the ®lm, on which the deposition kinetics was studied. The substrate temperature T G , at which the QCM studies of the growth process were performed, was varied from 100 to 4008C and stabilized with the accuracy of 0.18C. In addition to the conventional ALD process, we investigated the effect of subsequent exposures of TiO 2 ®lms to HCl and H 2 O. This enabled us to estimate the possible contribution of re-adsorption of gaseous reaction products to the thin ®lm growth.</p><p>Generally, the QCM method should enable one to estimate the abundance of adsorbed surface species, when a calibration procedure has been made and absolute values of mass changes have been measured. However, the mass sensors used in this work had very rough surfaces and therefore the actual surface areas of them were not known. Thus, only the relative mass changes were measured in this work because in no case, reliable determination of the mass exchange per unit area would have been possible. The reproducibility of our QCM measurements was mainly determined by the instability of the oscillation frequency. At T G 100±2008C, the frequency ¯uctuations did not exceed AE2 Hz. This enabled us to record the mass changes corresponding to a complete ALD cycle with the uncertainty of about AE5%. The instability increased with growth temperature and reached AE4 Hz at T G 4008C. As a result the corresponding experimental uncertainty of recording the mass increments mentioned above increased to AE10%.</p><p>The ®lms for ex situ characterization were grown on single crystal (1 0 0)-oriented silicon and amorphous silica substrates. During the growth, the substrate surface was parallel to the gas ¯ow direction. The TiCl 4 and H 2 O ¯ow rates were set at 0.9 and 8 mPa m 3 /s, respectively, while the precursor pulse times and purge times were equal to 2 s. The partial pressure corresponding to the H 2 O ¯ow rate used was about 6 Pa at the reactor outlet. Re¯ection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods were applied to characterize the structure of the ®lms while the Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) method was used for composition studies. The refractive index and thickness of the ®lms deposited on silica substrates were calculated from optical transmission spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the behavior of the mass sensor signal recorded during a single ALD cycle at two different mass sensor temperatures. During the TiCl 4 pulse, the mass, ®rst abruptly increased and then saturated. A decrease of the mass sensor signal followed when the TiCl 4 pulse was switched off at higher substrate temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This decrease demonstrated that some kind of surface intermediate species formed during TiCl 4 pulse or some precursor ligands were weakly bonded to the surface and could be easily released. At T G 3008C, the mass sensor signal decreased in the very beginning of the ®rst purge time and then stayed at an almost constant level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Therefore, the intermediate species that remained on the surface until beginning of the H 2 O pulse were stable and rather strongly bonded to the ®lm material. During the following H 2 O pulse the mass sensor signal rapidly decreased and stabilized on a new level. Decrease of the ®lm mass caused by the H 2 O pulse indicated that the surface intermediate species formed in the TiCl 4 adsorption process were heavier than the ®nal reaction products. This was not surprising because the former species might contain chlorine, which was replaced by much lighter oxygen or hydroxyl groups during an exposure to H 2 O. After switching off the H 2 O pulse, no changes were observed at T G 3008C. At 1008C, by contrast, an additional decrease appeared in the beginning of the second purge time. The latter decrease was probably due to dehydration of the ®lm surface.</p><p>The dependencies of the mass increments Dm 0 and Dm 1 on the growth temperature and precursor pulse times were studied on buffer layers deposited at two different temperatures. In the ®rst series of measurements a buffer layer was grown onto the mass sensor by applying 60 cycles at the mass sensor temperature of 1008C. According to the RHEED data, the ®lms deposited under such conditions were always amorphous. Using this kind of buffer layer the dependencies of Dm 0 and Dm 1 on the growth temperature (solid and open circles in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, respectively) were recorded in the range of 100±3508C by applying 10 cycles at each temperature. Altogether, 40 cycles were performed at temperatures 150±3508C where crystallization might take place. RHEED data showed that this was still not suf®cient to initiate crystal growth on amorphous substrates. It was revealed that in the beginning of the growth process, amorphous material was formed on silicon and silica substrates as well as on a buffer layer of amorphous TiO 2 grown at 1008C. The number of cycles needed for initiation of crystallization was about 100 cycles at T G 275±3508C but it increased with decreasing growth temperature (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). For this reason, one can conclude that the data obtained in the experiments, where only 40 cycles were applied to grow a ®lm on an amorphous buffer layer, described the growth of amorphous TiO 2 .</p><p>The second series of measurements was performed using a sensor coated with the buffer layer by applying 100 cycles at 3008C. In this case, more complex studies (Figs. 2±6) were carried out while the measurements were started at T G 4008C and continued at 350, 300, 250, 200, 150 and 1008C. The total thickness of the ®lm deposited on the mass sensor in this series was about 20 nm.</p><p>One can see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> that both Dm 0 and Dm 1 depended on the temperature, at which the real-time measurements were performed, as well as on the temperature, at which the buffer layer had been grown. The data depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> show that differently from the ®lms deposited at 1008C, those grown at 3008C and higher temperatures contained at least some amount of crystalline phase when the number  of cycles exceeded 100. Therefore, the structure of the buffer layer was probably one factor that in¯uenced the growth rate. At temperatures 150±3508C, for instance, considerably higher growth rates were obtained on the crystalline buffer layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). However, within the experimental uncertainty, there was no difference whether the deposition was performed onto the amorphous or crystalline layer at T G 100± 1508C.</p><p>The precursor pulse times affected the growth at temperatures close to 100 and 4008C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). The TiCl 4 pulse length in¯uenced Dm 0 , only, while the  Fig. 5. Dm 0 as a function of (a) the ®rst purge time and (b) the second purge time. Notation of cycle times is the same as in Fig. 3. Buffer layer was deposited at 3008C.</p><p>effect appeared at T G 4008C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(a)</ref>). By contrast, both Dm 0 and Dm 1 increased with the H 2 O pulse length at the lowest growth temperature studied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b)</ref>). In addition, it was revealed that variation of theTiCl 4 and H 2 O ¯uxes somewhat in¯uenced the value of Dm 0 . However, the effect was rather weak. Increase of the TiCl 4 and H 2 O ¯ow rates by the factor of three caused 5±10% increase in Dm 0 whereas remarkable effect of higher water dose appeared at T G 1008C, only.</p><p>The value of Dm 1 À Dm 0 , which equaled to Dm 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), had a maximum in the T G range of 250±3008C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) where the growth per cycle was lowest. At the same time the mass decrease Dm H 2 that was observed during the ®rst purge time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), monotonously increased with the mass sensor temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). As can be seen, the dependence of Dm H 2 on T B was rather weak. It was also revealed that within experimental uncertainty, Dm H 2 was independent of TiCl 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and H 2 O pulse times when they were varied from 0.5 to 5 s and the ®rst purge time was kept at 2 s.</p><p>In order to study the deposition process in more detail, the value of Dm 0 as a function of purge times was recorded at 150 and 3508C (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). At both temperatures, a fast decrease in Dm 0 took place with the increase of both purge times from 0.1 to 1 s. This effect was mainly related to the overlap of precursor pulses. Longer purge times used after TiCl 4 pulse did not in¯uence the growth rate at 1508C (Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>). At 3508C, however, Dm 0 decreased in the purge time range of 1±10 s, as well, indicating that the amount of titanium bonded to the surface decreased with increasing purge time. Such behavior of Dm 0 correlated with the decrease of the mass sensor signal by Dm H 2 , which occurred at higher temperatures during the ®rst purge time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Consequently, the latter mass decrease was related to desorption of titanium-containing surface intermediate species. The 1±10 s long purge times used after H 2 O pulse, contrary, did not affect Dm 0 rate at 3508C but in¯uenced it at 1508C (Fig. <ref type="figure">5(b)</ref>). The decrease of Dm 0 , which appeared with increasing second purge time at 1508C, was probably connected with dehydration of the ®lm surface. An evidence of such process was the mass decrease that was observed after switching off the H 2 O pulse at low temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>According to the data depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(a) the value of Dm 0 noticeably depended on the TiCl 4 pulse time at T G 4008C. At pulse times reaching 10 s, however, a similar dependence was observed at 3508C, as well (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Differently from Dm 0 , the value of Dm 1 as a function of TiCl 4 pulse time almost completely saturated at the latter temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). At the same time, Dm H 2 decreased with the increase of TiCl 4 exposure time from 2 to 10 s. As a result, no saturation of Dm 1 À Dm H 2 was obtained. This means that although Dm 1 saturated, the amount of strongly bonded surface intermediate species did not. Decrease of Dm H 2 with increasing TiCl 4 pulse time, in turn, indicated that the amount of weakly bonded surface intermediate species decreased during relatively long exposure times.</p><p>Subsequent exposures of the mass sensor to HCl and H 2 O performed at substrate temperatures 150± 3508C revealed some mass increase during the HCl pulse. The amplitude of that change depended on the substrate temperature and was around 30% of the Dm 2 value recorded in case of conventional TiCl 4 /H 2 O sequence at the same temperature. Evidently, the exposure to HCl did not form stable surface intermediate species because a few seconds after switching off the HCl pulse, the initial level of the mass sensor signal was recovered independently of whether the H 2 O pulse was applied or not. The fact that the HCl pulse formed no strongly bonded surface intermediates allowed us to suppose that re-adsorption of HCl could unlikely have a strong effect on the TiCl 4 adsorption. This conclusion was indirectly supported by the fact that the ®lms grown on silicon and silica substrates were of very uniform thickness independently of the growth temperature used. The thickness gradients, if existed at all, did not exceed few percent on the 60 mm 2 Â 30 mm 2 substrate area.</p><p>No chlorine signal was recorded by AES in the ®lms grown at 2758C whereas the sensitivity of the measurements was estimated to be about 0.04 at.%. Chlorine was detected in the ®lms grown at 200, 150 and 1008C but its concentration did not exceed 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 at.%, respectively. The O/Ti ratio of the ®lms grown at substrate temperatures of 150±2758C corresponded to stoichiometric TiO 2 within the experimental uncertainty of our AES measurements. In the ®lms grown at temperatures of 100±1258C, some oxygen de®ciency reaching up to 5±10% was still recorded.</p><p>XRD and RHEED measurements revealed that crystalline ®lms with anatase structure were obtained on silicon and silica substrates at the growth temperatures of 150±3508C. In addition to anatase, a minor amount of rutile was recorded in the ®lms grown at 4258C. As mentioned above, crystallization did not start from the beginning of the deposition process (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Similarly to earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, preferential orientation of crystallites was observed in crystalline ®lms of suf®cient thickness. The preferential orientation was strongest in the ®lms grown at substrate temperatures of 275±3508C. An interesting result was that the crystallinity of the ®lms, in particular those grown at 1508C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), was lower at the leading edges of substrates, which were closer to the inlet of the precursors.</p><p>The growth rates determined from optical measurements of the ®lms grown on silica substrates by applying 3000 ALD cycles at 100, 150, 275 and 4258C were 0.078, 0.048, 0.072 and 0.050 nm per cycle, respectively. Comparing these values with the data presented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, one can ®nd that the growth rate calculated from the thickness of relatively thick ®lms behaved with changing substrate temperature in a rather different way than Dm 0 did. Partially the relatively high growth rate of thicker ®lms at 2758C can be explained by lower density of those compared with the ®lms grown at 150 and 4258C. Indeed, the values of the refractive index of the ®lms grown at 100, 150, 275 and 4258C equaled to 2.37, 2.63, 2.37 and 2.55, respectively. Thus, the ®lms grown at 2758C were really of lower density than those grown at 150 and 4258C. However, the differ-ence in the refractive index was about 10%, only. At the same time the growth rate was about 1.5 times higher at 2758C than at 150 and 4258C. For this reason, one should consider the possibility that crystallization, which affected the growth rate of very thin ®lms, already (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), even stronger in¯uenced the deposition of thicker ®lms, in which the crystal structure and preferential orientation were more developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The data presented in the previous section indicate that at the growth temperatures of 100±3508C and TiCl 4 doses used, adsorption of TiCl 4 saturates during few seconds, already. The data also show that the mass of surface intermediate species formed is higher than that of the solid reaction product obtained after H 2 O pulse. Most of the surface intermediate species formed during TiCl 4 adsorption are stable and strongly bonded to the surface. However, decrease of the ®lm mass during the ®rst purge time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and dependence of Dm 0 on that purge length (Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>) still indicates desorption of some intermediate species from the surface. The species that stay on the surface react with H 2 O in the next reaction step. As revealed by the post-growth studies, the result of such two-step reaction is stoichiometric TiO 2 provided that T G ! 1508C. In addition to the exchange of adsorbed chlorine ligands, H 2 O is obviously able to create surface hydroxyl groups on the as-grown TiO 2 ®lm. The decrease of the mass sensor signal observed at T G 1008C after the H 2 O pulse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), in turn, indicates that during the second purge, dehydration of the surface takes place. The abundance of surface hydroxyl groups remaining on the surface evidently depends on the temperature as well as on the purge length used. Indeed, it has been shown that the stable concentration of hydroxyl groups residing on the surface of TiO 2 decreases with increasing temperature. However, some abundance of them has been recorded at temperatures exceeding 4008C <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. When TiCl 4 adsorbs on such surface, exchange reactions are possible. For instance, in the exchange reaction with two hydroxyl groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, two chlorine ligands can be released from adsorbing TiCl 4 2ÀOHs TiCl 4 g 3 ÀOÀ 2 TiCl 2 s 2HClg</p><p>while the rest of chlorine ligands can be replaced in the next reaction step</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ÀOÀ 2 TiCl 2 s 2H 2 Og 3 ÀOÀ 2 TiOH 2 s 2HClg<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The equations describing the surface reactions allow one to calculate the relative mass changes corresponding to different reaction steps. In case of the TiCl 4 adsorption reaction (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)), the mass increase equals to M i À M h , where M i is the mass of surface intermediate species (TiCl 2 ) and M h the mass of hydrogen replaced by one species. A complete ALD cycle causes the mass increase M o , which equals to the molar mass of ®lm material (TiO 2 ). Evidently, the M o aM i À M h ratio does not depend on the abundance of surface intermediate species provided that there is no desorption of titanium-containing species during the reaction with water vapor.</p><p>QCM measurements show that rather stable surface intermediate layer is obtained on the ®lm surface after the 2 s long ®rst purge time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Therefore, comparing the M o aM i À M h ratio with the values of Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 obtained at different growth temperatures, one can reveal the most probable reaction mechanisms. For instance, the M o aM i À M h ratio calculated from Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is equal to 0.68. It can be seen, however, that this value ®ts to the experimental Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 ratios (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>) at T G 4008C, only.</p><p>Better agreement can be obtained, when assuming that TiCl 4 reacts with one surface hydroxyl group ÀOHs TiCl 4 g 3 ÀOÀTiCl 3 s HClg</p><p>In this case the following H 2 O pulse should remove three chlorine ligands and form one hydroxyl group in order to recover the initial abundance of hydroxyl groups on the ®lm surface</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ÀOÀTiCl 3 s 2H 2 Og 3 ÀOÀTiOOHs 3HClg<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Correspondingly, the M o aM i À M h ratio is equal to 0.52. This value ®ts to the experimental data at T G 100±1508C. At temperatures 200±3508C, however, the Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 ratios are still signi®cantly lower (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). This fact allows one to suppose that in the latter temperature range, the TiCl 4 adsorption could proceed without any release of gaseous reaction products. Such process may be described as dissociation of TiCl 4 on the dehydroxylated surface followed by adsorption of TiCl 3 and Cl <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Corresponding M o aM i À M h value is equal to 0.42, i.e. very close to the experimental Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 as a function of growth temperature determined at different TiCl 4 pulse times. Buffer layers were grown at temperatures of 100 and 3008C. Notation of cycle times is the same as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. ratios obtained at substrate temperatures of 200± 3508C. However, existing experimental data <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> indicate that the TiO 2 surface is unlikely hydroxylfree at these temperatures. Therefore, one should consider the possibility that reacting with hydroxyl groups, TiCl 4 could form surface Ti(OH) x Cl 4Àx species with 1 x 3. This reaction may also proceed without formation gaseous reaction products and result in M o aM i À M h 0X42 Ti(OH) x Cl 4Àx has been considered to be a volatile surface species that can migrate on the ®lm surface and be responsible for agglomeration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> in the ALD process. The results obtained in this work also indicate that some kind of intermediate species may really contribute to the crystal growth. Indeed, the ®lms were more crystalline at the trailing edge of substrates. Thus, drift of some intermediate species in the gas ¯ow direction and re-adsorption of them might be considered as an effect that accelerates crystallization.</p><p>Under certain conditions Ti(OH) x Cl 4Àx obviously releases HCl and forms TiO 2 or TiOCl 2 on the solid surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Consequently, both desorption of volatile Ti(OH) x Cl 4Àx and decomposition of that cause a decrease in the ®lm mass without H 2 O supply and could well explain the mass decrease observed during the ®rst purge time. Furthermore, if the decomposition of surface Ti(OH) x Cl 4Àx took place during the TiCl 4 pulse, already, a smaller mass decrease would appear during the following purge time. Simultaneously, additional adsorption sites should be created for TiCl 4 adsorption and an increase of Dm 0 should be observed with increasing TiCl 4 pulse time. This kind of effect (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) was recorded in our QCM measurements. When increasing the TiCl 4 pulse time and the following purge time up to 10 s, a noticeable decrease in Dm H 2 was obtained. Moreover, the Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 ratio as high as 0.62 was observed at T G 3508C. This is considerably higher than the value of 0.44±0.47 recorded at TiCl 4 pulse time of 0.5±5 s and purge time of 2 s at the same temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The average Cl/Ti ratio in the surface intermediate species that was estimated from the Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 ratio was about 2.5 after the 10 s long TiCl 4 pulse and 10 s long purge time. This value is rather close to those reported for the TiCl 4 /H 2 O process performed on silica catalyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that although the model, which assumes formation of Ti(OH) x Cl 4Àx during the TiCl 4 pulse, very well explains all experimental results, the QCM data alone do not allow one to exclude the possible role of TiCl 4 adsorption on dehydroxylated sites. Indeed, if the surface oxychlorides that could be formed in the latter process were suf®ciently volatile and able to decompose, all effects described above would be also observed. Nevertheless, the QCM studies unambiguously con®rm that at temperatures of 200±3508C, close to four chlorine atoms are adsorbed together with each titanium atom.</p><p>At temperatures below 200 and above 3508C, the amount of adsorbed chloride decreases. Simultaneously, as can be seen in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the growth rate increases at these temperatures. The reason for reduced chlorine concentration in the surface intermediate species formed at T G `2008C is evidently increasing abundance of hydroxyl groups or even molecular water on the surface where TiCl 4 is adsorbed. At temperatures above 3508C, however, smaller Cl/Ti ratio in the adsorbate layer is connected with faster decomposition of the surface intermediate species. One could further speculate that the reactions with surface hydroxyl groups and/or decomposition of surface intermediate species reduce the mobility of the latter. Such conclusion is strongly supported by the fact that the texture was preferentially formed at temperatures 275± 3508C where no chlorine was released during TiCl 4 adsorption. At the same time, the texture development was hindered at T G `200 and T G b 3508C where the Cl/Ti ratio was lower than four in the surface intermediate layer.</p><p>The idea about formation of slowly decomposing surface species explains why the data characterizing the thin ®lm growth on planar substrates differ from those describing the process on silica catalysts [ <ref type="bibr">13± 16</ref>]. In the latter case TiCl 4 pulse times as long as 2 h were used. This time allows the unstable surface intermediate species to decompose and form oxychlorides as predicted by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and (3) (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>). In the thin ®lm growth processes, by contrast, the TiCl 4 pulse times have been usually few seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> or even shorter <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Our results show that this is insuf®cient to completely stabilize the surface intermediate layer formed in the TiCl 4 adsorption step.</p><p>As discussed above, the reaction between surface hydroxyl groups and HCl released in reactions described by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>), can additionally contribute to chlorine trapping at the ®lm surface. The experimental results obtained show, however, that this is not the main effect responsible for relatively low growth rate. First, the HCl pulse created much lower surface coverage of chlorine than the reactions with TiCl 4 did. Secondly, the surface coverage formed during the HCl pulse was not stable. Finally, very uniform thickness of the ®lms con®rmed that the in¯uence of HCl re-adsorption could not be remarkable.</p><p>Results presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> indicate that within our experimental uncertainty, the deposition temperature and the structure of the buffer layer had no effect on the Dm 0 aDm 1 À Dm H 2 ratio. Similarly, the thin ®lm structure had no measurable in¯uence on desorption of surface intermediate species (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). At the same time, the amounts of TiCl 4 adsorbed on the TiO 2 layers of dissimilar origin differed considerably (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). These facts demonstrate that the effect of surface microstructure on the TiO 2 growth is more signi®cantly related to the number of adsorption sites than to the changes in adsorption and/or desorption mechanisms. A probable reason for the increased number of adsorption sites on the surface of (crystalline) ®lms grown at T G 3008C is agglomeration <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and corresponding increase in effective surface area. Signi®cant surface roughening that has been observed at T G ! 1508C with development of the crystal structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> strongly supports this conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have revealed in this work that signi®cant amount of chlorine that is bonded to the surface during TiCl 4 adsorption, is the main reason for rather limited growth rate in the TiCl 4 /H 2 O ALD process. Some chlorine is released in the TiCl 4 adsorption step at temperatures below 2008C and above 3508C. At intermediate temperatures, however, most of chlorine that contains in TiCl 4 is adsorbed in the initial stage of interaction between TiCl 4 and TiO 2 surface exposed to H 2 O. With the increase of the TiCl 4 pulse time and the following purge time, especially at higher growth temperatures, the Cl/Ti ratio in the surface intermedi-ate species decreases, indicating that a decomposition process proceeds on the ®lm surface after adsorption of precursor molecules. Simultaneously, some titanium-containing surface intermediate species are released from the ®lm surface during the purge time. Surface migration of these weakly bonded surface intermediate species evidently contributes to the crystallization process because the ®lms are more crystalline at the trailing edge of substrates. The crystallization process, in turn, in¯uences the growth rate. The QCM data indicate that the growth rate increase observed with the initiation of crystal growth is due to more effective adsorption of TiCl 4 on the crystalline ®lm than on the amorphous TiO 2 .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Applied</head><figDesc>Surface Science 172 (2001) 148±158</figDesc></figure>
