Its large band gap  $(\\approx 14\\mathrm{eV})$  and low refractive index  $(n\\approx 1.39$  at  $580\\mathrm{nm}$  ) make it a good window material in the ultraviolet region of electromagnetic radiation.[1,2] LiF is sensitive to both high energy electromagnetic radiation, such as X- rays and gamma rays, and low- energy electrons and ions, easily forming color centers, which can be utilized in imaging detectors and dosimetry.[2- 7] In addition, LiF has been used in organic plastic solar cells to improve the contact between the Al electrode and the organic layer,[8] and in organic light- emitting devices (OLEDs) as a cathode material, combined with Al.[9- 12]",

        "text": "Thus far, thin films of LiF have been deposited using a rather narrow selection of methods. Thermal evaporation of solid LiF is an often used deposition method,[1,2,4,6,7,13] sometimes being assisted by low- energy ions such as Xe or Ar.[3,14] Pulsed laser deposition has also been utilized,[15,16] as well as electron beam evaporation,[17- 19] and DC magnetron sputtering.[20] Chemical methods, such as CVD and ALD have, to our knowledge, not been reported. ALD in particular is an interesting method for LiF deposition, as this technique is known for producing uniform and conformal thin films with precise thickness control.[21] The absence of LiF among materials deposited by ALD is most likely due to the limited number of lithium precursors available for both CVD and ALD,[22- 24] and the hazardous nature of the two simple fluoride precursors, HF and  $\\mathrm{F}_2$ . Several other metal fluorides have previously been deposited by ALD with the method introduced by Pilvi and coworkers, i.e., using metal  $\\beta$ - diketonates and titanium or tantalum fluorides as precursors.[25- 29] These solid fluoride precursors have volatility in the proper range so that they can be efficiently transported by modest heating. Furthermore, they can be safely handled and condensed from exhaust gases at room temperature. They are also thermally stable and undergo surprisingly clean exchange reactions with many metal- thd complexes, producing corresponding metal fluoride films. Therefore, in these experiments, Lithd (lithium 2,2,6,6- tetramethyl- 3,5- heptanedionate) was chosen as the lithium precursor and TiF4 was used as the fluoride source.",

The lower limit for the deposition temperature was chosen to maintain the temperature gradient around the Lithd source essentially constant. Already during the first experiments it was noted that the process is extremely sensitive with regard to the temperature gradient within close proximity to the precursor boats. Changing the gradient resulted in highly profiled films with large, flaky deposits. With careful control of the reactor temperatures, uniform films could be deposited and the experiments were reproducible.

The growth rate does not show a plateau typical for most binary ALD processes.[21] Rather, the growth rate decreases when going from 250 to  $325^{\\circ}C$  and increases again at  $350^{\\circ}C$  A decreasing growth rate with increasing deposition temperature has previously been seen in other fluoride processes,[25- 27] possibly due to a decreasing density of  $\\mathrm{TiF}_x$  groups formed on the film surface. However, the increase of the growth rate at  $350^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  is more unusual.

        "text": "We have demonstrated, for the first time, a method of depositing LiF by ALD. This method utilizes Lithd and  $\\mathrm{TiF_4}$  as precursors, and results in highly crystalline LiF films in the temperature range  $250–350^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The process does not show a temperature range of constant growth rate typical for many ALD processes. Still, the film thickness can be easily controlled by changing the number of deposition cycles. The films show an increasing rms roughness and grain size when going to higher deposition temperatures, as has previously been seen in LiF processes using other deposition methods. The high surface roughness can be a problem in optical applications of LiF. Also, the adhesion of the films to the substrate is rather poor, especially with thicker films deposited at higher temperatures. The films are pure LiF according to both XRD and ERDA, showing oxygen impurities of the order of  $1\\mathrm{at. - \\%}$ . Both carbon and hydrogen impurities are below  $1\\mathrm{at. - \\%}$  at all growth temperatures.",

Deposition temperatures were varied between 250 and  $350^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The pressure inside the reactor was of the order of 5 mbar during depositions. The films were deposited onto  $5\\mathrm{cm}\\times 5\\mathrm{cm}$  Si(111) substrates with native  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  on top. Lithd (Volatec Oy, Finland), and  $\\mathrm{TiF_4}$  (Strem Chemicals Inc.,  $98\\%$ ) were evaporated inside the reactor from open glass boats at 180 and  $135^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. Pulsing of the precursors was done by inert gas valving. The  $\\mathrm{TiF_4}$  pulse length was varied between  $0.5$  and  $6\\mathrm{s}$ , and the Lithd pulse was  $1$  and  $4\\mathrm{s}$ . Nitrogen produced by a Parker domnick hunter G21000 nitrogen generator, was used as the carrier and purging gas. A purge time of  $4\\mathrm{s}$  was used between the precursor pulses to separate these pulses and remove gaseous reaction side products.",
