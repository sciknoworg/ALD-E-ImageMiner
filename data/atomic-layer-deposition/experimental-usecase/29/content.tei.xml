<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Tungsten nitride films were deposited with atomic layer control using sequential surface reactions. The tungsten nitride film growth was accomplished by separating the binary reaction 2WF 6 ϩ NH 3 r W 2 N ϩ 3HF ϩ 9/2F 2 into two half-reactions. Successive application of the WF 6 and NH 3 half-reactions in an ABAB… sequence produced tungsten nitride deposition at substrate temperatures between 600 and 800 K. Transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy monitored the coverage of WF x * and NH y * surface species on high surface area particles during the WF 6 and NH 3 half-reactions. The FTIR spectroscopic results demonstrated that the WF 6 and NH 3 half-reactions were complete and self-limiting at temperatures Ն600 K. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry monitored the film growth on Si(100) substrates vs. temperature and reactant exposure. A tungsten nitride deposition rate of 2.55 Å/AB cycle was measured at 600-800 K for WF 6 and NH 3 reactant exposures Ն3000 L and 10,000 L, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth-profiling experiments determined that the films had a W 2 N stoichiometry with low C and O impurity concentrations. X-ray diffraction investigations revealed that the tungsten nitride films were microcrystalline. Atomic force microscopy measurements of the deposited films observed remarkably flat surfaces indicating smooth film growth. These smooth tungsten nitride films deposited with atomic layer control should be useful as diffusion barriers for Cu on contact and via holes.</p></div>

Application of the half-reactions in a ABAB… reaction sequence results in atomic layer deposition. If the surface half-reactions are allowed to reach completion everywhere on the substrate, changes in reactant pressure or total reactant exposure will not change the growth per AB cycle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The atomic layer deposition of tungsten nitride was investigated using two sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, in situ transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy experiments were performed on high surface area particles to monitor the surface chemical reactions during the tungsten nitride film growth. The coverages of WF x * and NH y * surface species were monitored vs. time by observing the W-F x stretching mode and the N-H y stretching and bending modes. In the second set of experiments, tungsten nitride films were deposited on Si(100) substrates and examined using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. The ellipsometry measurements determined the tungsten nitride film thickness and index of refraction vs. deposition temperature and reactant exposure.</p><p>These two sets of experiments revealed that atomic layer controlled growth of tungsten nitride can be attained using sequential exposures to WF 6 and NH 3 . Additional atomic force microscopy studies characterized the flatness of the tungsten nitride films relative to the initial Si(100) substrate. The tungsten nitride film properties were also evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth-profiling to determine film stoichiometry and X-ray diffraction experiments to ascertain film structure. These studies all indicate that atomic layer deposition techniques should be useful in depositing ultrathin and conformal tungsten nitride diffusion barriers in semiconductor device fabrication.</p></div>

The SiO 2 surface was further cleaned in vacuum by an anneal at 900 K for 5 min. This thermal anneal was followed by a high frequency H 2 O plasma discharge at 300 K. This H 2 O plasma fully hydroxylated the SiO 2 surface and removed surface carbon contamination.

Under these conditions, FTIR spectroscopy indicates that Si 2 H 6 reacts with the surface hydroxyl groups and deposits surface species containing Si-H stretching vibrations: e.g., SiOH* ϩ Si 2 H 6 r SiOSiH 3 * ϩ SiH 4 . After the initial Si 2 H 6 treatment, tungsten nitride film growth could be performed at reaction temperatures between 550-800 K.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>FTIR spectroscopy studies of surface chemistry.-Several infrared difference spectra recorded during the NH 3 half-reaction at 600 K are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. These infrared difference spectra are referenced to a tungsten nitride surface that had earlier received a saturation exposure of WF 6 at 600 K. The spectra after various NH 3 exposures are offset for clarity in presentation. The infrared spectra show N-H 2 stretching vibrations at ~ 3450 cm Ϫ1 and N-H 2 scissors vibrations at ϳ1500 cm Ϫ1 . These results indicate that the NH y * surface species is primarily a NH 2 * surface species. The infrared spectra also display W-F x stretching vibrations at 680 cm Ϫ1 . The spectra reveal a gradual increase in the dominant NH 2 * surface species that is coupled with a corresponding loss in WF x * surface species vs. NH 3 exposure. The loss of WF x * surface species appears as a negative absorbance.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> displays infrared difference spectra recorded during the subsequent WF 6 exposure at 600 K. The difference spectra are again offset to display the changes vs. WF 6 exposure. Each difference spectrum displays the change in the infrared absorbance referenced to a tungsten nitride surface that had received a saturation NH 3 exposure at 600 K. The gain of WF x * surface species is concurrent with a loss of NH 2 * surface species. The loss of NH 2 * surface species appears as a negative absorbance.</p><p>The normalized integrated absorbances during the NH 3 and WF 6 half-reactions are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. The loss of WF x * surface species during the NH 3 half-reaction occurs more rapidly than the corresponding gain of the NH 2 * surface species. This behavior indi-cates that each NH 3 molecule may initially react with multiple WF x * surface species. In contrast, the gain of WF x * surface species during the WF 6 half-reaction is concurrent with the loss of NH 2 * surface   and <ref type="figure">W-F</ref> x stretch regions recorded after various WF 6 exposures during the WF 6 halfreaction at 600 K.

This behavior indicates a 1:1 reaction between WF 6 and NH 2 * surface species.</p><p>The loss of NH 2 * surface coverage during the WF 6 half-reaction results in the growth of WF x * surface coverage. When the WF 6 halfreaction reaches completion, this WF x * surface coverage is equivalent to the WF x * surface coverage measured prior to the NH 3 half-reaction. Similarly, the loss of WF x * surface coverage during the NH 3 halfreaction results in the growth of NH 2 * surface coverage that becomes equivalent to the NH 2 * surface coverage measured prior to the WF 6 half-reaction. These results indicate that the NH 3 and WF 6 surface reactions proceed to completion at 600 K with sufficient reactant exposure. In addition, each reaction is self-limiting and terminates with the consumption of the initial surface functional groups.</p><p>Infrared difference spectra were also recorded during the WF 6 and NH 3 half-reactions at 700 and 500 K. At 700 K, the WF 6 and NH 3 half-reactions were observed to be faster than at 600 K. However, conductance limitations in the high surface area silica powder prevented a quantitative description of the relative reaction rates. The half-reactions at 700 K were self-limiting and terminated with the consumption of the initial surface species. The integrated absorbances for the WF 6 and NH 3 half-reactions at 700 K showed that the initial loss of WF x * surface species during the NH 3 half-reaction did not correspond with a concurrent growth of NH 2 * surface species. This behavior is consistent with each NH 3 molecule initially reacting with even more WF x * surface species at 700 than at 600 K. In contrast, the WF 6 half-reaction at 700 K occurred with a concurrent gain of WF x * surface species and loss of NH 2 * surface species. At 500 K, the NH 3 half-reaction was observed to saturate after removing only ϳ60 % of the WF x * surface species. Larger NH 3 reactant exposures did not remove additional WF x * surface species. This behavior indicates that the NH 3 half-reaction does not proceed to completion at 500 K. In contrast, the WF 6 half-reaction was observed to consume all of the surface NH y * species resulting from the NH 3 reaction at 500 K. The WF 6 half-reaction at 500 K was also performed on a tungsten nitride surface that had earlier received a saturation exposure of NH 3 at 600 K. This experiment revealed that sufficient WF 6 exposures can consume all the NH y * surface species at 500 K. The inability of the NH 3 half-reaction to react with all WF x * surface species at 500 K indicates that tungsten nitride film growth should be performed at temperatures Ն600 K to obtain the best tungsten nitride films.</p><p>Spectroscopic ellipsometry studies of film growth.-The dependence of the half-reactions on the WF 6 and NH 3 reactant exposures was examined by measuring the tungsten nitride film thickness deposited by 3 AB cycles at 600 K. A typical AB cycle occurred with the following sequence: expose WF 6 (1-10 mTorr)/N 2 purge 1-3 min/ expose NH 3 (1-10 mTorr)/N 2 purge 1-3 min. The ellipsometric measurements shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and 7 demonstrate that the WF 6 and NH 3 half-reactions are self-limiting at 600 K. Once a half-reaction reaches completion, additional reactant exposure produces no additional film growth.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> displays the tungsten nitride film thickness obtained vs. NH 3 reactant exposure with a WF 6 reactant exposure of 4300 L. This WF 6 exposure is sufficient for a complete WF 6 half-reaction. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows that the NH 3 half-reaction is incomplete and the tungsten nitride film thickness deposited by three AB cycles is dependent on NH 3 reactant exposure for NH 3 exposures &lt;10,000 L. In contrast, additional NH 3 exposure results in no further tungsten nitride deposition for NH 3 exposures Ն10,000 L. The surface reactions are complete and self-limiting in this regime. The error bars represent the 90% confidence limits determined by the uncertainty in the ellipsometric data. The solid line is intended only to guide the eye.</p><p>The film thicknesses measured in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> were obtained with a variable WF 6 exposure and a NH 3 reactant exposure of 12,000 L. This NH 3 exposure is sufficient for a complete NH 3 half-reaction. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> shows that the tungsten nitride film thickness deposited by 3 AB cycles is dependent on the WF 6 reactant exposure for WF 6 exposures &lt;3000 L. In contrast, additional WF 6 reactant exposure results in no additional tungsten nitride deposition for WF 6 reactant exposures Ն3000 L.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the ellipsometric measurements of the tungsten nitride film thickness vs. the number of AB cycles at 600 K. The WF 6 reactant exposure of 4300 L and NH 3 reactant exposure of 12,000 L were sufficient for complete half-reactions during each AB cycle. The film thickness is directly proportional to the number of AB cycles. The solid line displays the least squares linear fit to the data.</p><p>The tungsten nitride film thickness vs. number of AB cycles is extremely linear. The least squares fit yields a growth rate of 2.55 Å/ AB cycle at 600 K. This growth rate agrees well with the W 2 N lattice constant of 2.4 Å obtained by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) meas-Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.

The linear growth rate indicates that the number of reactive surface sites remains constant during tungsten nitride deposition. The constant growth rate also argues that the tungsten nitride films are growing with no surface roughening.</p><p>The ellipsometric measurements of the tungsten nitride film thickness deposited by three AB reaction cycles vs. substrate temperature are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>. The WF 6 and NH 3 reactant exposures at each temperature were sufficient for complete half-reactions and additional reactant exposure resulted in no further deposition. The solid line connects the data points, and the error bars represent the 90% confidence limits. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> shows that the tungsten nitride film thickness deposited by three AB cycles increases rapidly with substrate temperature from 400 to 600 K. In this temperature regime, the FTIR spectroscopy measurements indicate that the surface halfreactions do not proceed to completion and may produce a WF 6 :NH 3 adduct species.</p><p>After the rapid rise vs. temperature from 400 to 600 K, the tungsten nitride film thickness deposited by 3 AB cycles increases only very slightly for substrate temperatures between 600-800 K. These temperatures are sufficient for complete half-reactions according to the FTIR vibrational studies. The nearly constant tungsten nitride deposition rate of ϳ2.5 Å/AB cycle for temperatures between 600 and 800 K is consistent with the thickness of a W 2 N monolayer.</p><p>The surface topography of the deposited tungsten nitride films was examined with an atomic force microscope (AFM) operating in tapping mode (Digital Instruments-Nanoscope III). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> shows a 3.0 by 3.0 m scan of a ϳ350 Å thick tungsten nitride film deposited by 140 AB cycles at 600 K. The reactant exposures were sufficient for both half-reactions to reach completion for all 140 AB cycles. The light-to-dark gray scale in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> spans less than 25 Å.</p><p>The AFM images of the deposited tungsten nitride films exhibit a surface roughness of Ϯ6.1 Å (root-mean-square). In comparison, the surface roughness of the initial SiO 2 surface on Si(100) was Ϯ2.5 Å. The power spectral density of the surface roughness also exhibited the same statistical characteristics as the initial SiO 2 surface on Si(100). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> This smooth surface topography with a roughness comparable to the initial surface indicates that the tungsten nitride films are growing with negligible roughening.</p><p>The tungsten nitride film composition was evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth-profiling. a The XPS depthprofiling experiments employed a 4 kV Ar ϩ ion beam operating with a 10 mA/cm 2 ion current to sputter slowly through the 350 Å thick tungsten film. The surface of the tungsten nitride film exhibited characteristic signals for W, C, N, F, and O atoms. After several minutes of sputtering through the surface region, the elemental concentrations in the bulk tungsten nitride film were constant until encountering the underlying SiO 2 film.</p><p>The XPS depth-profiling results revealed that the bulk tungsten nitride films had a W to N ratio of ϳ3:1. The films also contained small atomic percentage concentrations of ϳ5% C and ϳ3.6% O. These impurities may be attributed to CO dissociation resulting from the CO partial pressures in our diffusion-pumped central deposition    S0013-4651(99)05-028-4 CCC: $7.00 © The Electrochemical Society, Inc.</p><p>chamber. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Alternatively, the impurities may result from artifacts encountered during Ar ϩ sputtering of metal and metal nitride films. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> The large W:N ratio may result from the preferential removal of N atoms by Ar ϩ sputtering that is often observed for metal nitrides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Glancing angle XRD experiments were also performed to evaluate the crystallographic structure of the tungsten nitride films. [See footnote a on the previous page.] Using Cu K␣ radiation incident at 4Њ, the tungsten nitride films displayed several diffraction peaks at angles 2 equal to 37, 43, and 63Њ. The most dominant peak was observed at 37Њ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Surface chemistry of tungsten nitride deposition.-The surface chemistry of tungsten nitride deposition can be studied by monitoring the vibrational absorption features of the NH y * and WF x * surface species. The N-H y vibrational stretching region of the infrared spectra exhibits significant changes with reaction temperature. At 700 K, the N-H y stretching region exhibited two sharp features at 3435 and 3515 cm Ϫ1 that are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of NH 2 * surface species. The N-H y bending region displayed a strong peak at 1550 cm Ϫ1 that is attributed to the N-H 2 scissors mode. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> The frequencies of these three modes are consistent with NH 2 * surface species with three-coordinate N atoms (W-NH 2 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> A small peak also appeared at 1485 cm Ϫ1 that can be assigned to four-coordinate surface N atoms (W 2 -NH 2 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Reduction of the reaction temperature to 600 K resulted in several new spectral features that are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. In addition to the 3435 and 3515 cm Ϫ1 features observed at 700 K, the N-H 2 stretching region also displays two new features located at 3350 and 3290 cm Ϫ1 . In addition to the 1550 cm Ϫ1 peak observed at 700 K, the N-H y bending region also reveals a prominent 1485 cm Ϫ1 feature and a weak 1610 cm Ϫ1 feature. The additional infrared features at 600 K are attributed to NH 2 * surface species with four-coordinate N atoms (W 2 -NH 2 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> These four-coordinate surface N atoms exist together with the three-coordinate surface N atoms. The 1610 cm Ϫ1 feature is attributed to a small NH 3 * surface coverage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> Further changes in the N-H y stretching and bending regions occur when the reaction temperature is lowered to 500 K. The three-coordinate N-H 2 stretching and bending modes are nearly extinguished at 3515, 3435, and 1550 cm Ϫ1 . In addition, the four-coordinate N-H 2 stretching and bending modes are persistent at 3350, 3290, and 1485 cm Ϫ1 . Two prominent spectral features are also observed at 3455 and 1610 cm Ϫ1 . These new features are attributed to molecular NH 3 * surface species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> The presence of molecular NH 3 * surface species may indicate the formation of an WF x :NH 3 adduct. This adduct has been observed earlier when using WF 6 and NH 3 reactants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Tungsten nitride films that have incorporated the WF x :NH 3 adduct exhibit poor adhesion and electrical properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> The W-F x stretching vibration in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> is observed at ϳ680 cm Ϫ1 . This vibrational feature exhibited only subtle changes with reaction temperature. The W-F x stretching mode broadened and shifted to slightly higher frequencies as the reaction temperature was lowered from 700 to 500 K. This frequency shift may be consistent with a higher coverage of surface fluorine species at lower reaction temperatures.</p><p>An analysis of the normalized integrated absorbance data presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> yields additional details about the reactions at 600 K. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>, loss of WF x * surface coverage during the NH 3 half-reaction is coincident with the gain of NH 2 * surface coverage. Likewise, the loss of NH 2 * surface coverage in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref> is always concurrent with the growth of WF x * surface coverage. This symmetry between loss and gain suggests that both the half-reactions occur in an approximately 1:1 fashion. The NH 3 reactant consumes WF x * surface species and deposits NH 2 * surface species. The WF 6 reactant consumes NH 2 * surface species and deposits WF x * surface species.</p><p>The FTIR spectra are consistent with self-limiting surface chemistry and the atomic layer controlled growth of tungsten nitride. The FTIR spectra do display some temperature dependence that may affect the deposited film stoichiometry. At 700 K during the NH 3 half-reaction, the WF x * surface coverage initially decreases with very little corresponding increase in the NH 2 * surface coverage. This observation suggests that each NH 3 molecule can react initially with multiple WF x * surface species at 700 K. During the WF 6 half-reaction at 700 K, the loss of NH 2 * surface coverage and gain of WF x * surface coverage are symmetrical and similar to the behavior observed at 600 K.</p><p>When the reaction temperature is lowered to 500 K, the NH 3 precursor cannot react with all of the WF x * surface species. This NH 3 half-reaction saturates after removing only ~60 % of the initial WF x * surface coverage. In contrast, the WF 6 half-reaction displays very symmetrical behavior at 500 K. The loss of N-H y absorbance features and gain of W-F x absorbance features are in close correspondence.</p><p>The temperature dependence of the NH 3 half-reaction suggests that the N content of the deposited tungsten nitride films may change with reaction temperature. A lower N content may be observed at 700 K because each NH 3 molecule can initially react with multiple WF x * surface species. This prediction is consistent with other studies that observe lower N concentrations in tungsten nitride films deposited at higher reaction temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Likewise, a lower N content may also be measured at 500 K because the NH 3 half-reaction does not proceed to completion. These predictions should be tested by evaluating the stoichiometry of tungsten nitride films deposited at different substrate temperatures.</p><p>Tungsten nitride film growth on Si(100).-Figures <ref type="figure">6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> demonstrate the self-limiting nature of the NH 3 and WF 6 half-reactions at 600 K. These results reveal that NH 3 exposures of 10,000 L and WF 6 exposures of 3000 L are needed for complete surface half-reactions at 600 K. Using saturation exposures of NH 3 and WF 6 , the deposited tungsten nitride thickness vs. number of AB reaction cycles was examined in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. The film growth was extremely linear with a tungsten nitride deposition rate of 2.55 Å/AB cycle.</p><p>The linear growth observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> indicates that the tungsten nitride films are growing very smoothly on the Si(100) substrate. The AFM image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> confirms the deposition of very smooth and uniform tungsten nitride films. The surface roughness of this tungsten nitride film is only Ϯ6.1 Å (root-mean-square). The slight roughness of this film may be attributed in part to the presence of small tungsten nitride crystallites.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> reveals that the tungsten nitride deposition is very constant for temperatures Ն600 K. This constant deposition rate vs. temperature was not observed in earlier studies of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 atomic layer controlled growth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> This earlier temperature dependence was attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups on Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 by dehydroxylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> The constant tungsten nitride deposition rate vs. temperature may result from the higher thermal stability of the WF x * and NH 2 * surface species. If the WF x * and NH 2 * surface coverages remain constant at Ն600 K, the same number of tungsten and nitrogen atoms should be deposited each AB cycle.</p><p>The spectroscopic ellipsometric measurements determined that the real and imaginary refractive index (ñ ϭ n ϩ ik) varied with film thickness. The refractive index was n ϭ 2.2 Ϯ 0.6 and k ϭ 0.7 Ϯ 0.3 at ϭ 632 nm for a 45 Å thick tungsten nitride film. The refractive index was n ϭ 3.29 Ϯ 0.35 and k ϭ 1.78 Ϯ 0.27 at ϭ 632 nm for a 275 Å thick film. Tungsten nitride film thicknesses Ն275 Å resulted in no further change in the refractive index.</p><p>The changing refractive index with film thickness may simply result from the evolution of the electronic band structure with film thickness. The film composition is not believed to vary vs. film S0013-4651(99)05-028-4 CCC: $7.00 © The Electrochemical Society, Inc. thickness because the tungsten nitride deposition rate per AB cycle remained constant vs. film thickness. The measured optical constants for the thick tungsten nitride films Ն275 Å are consistent with tungsten nitride films that have a W:N ratio between 2:1 and 1:1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> Tungsten nitride films thicker than ϳ500 Å could not be measured using ellipsometry because of strong light absorption by the metallic film.</p><p>Tungsten nitride films commonly exist as W 2 N or WN with a 2:1 or 1:1 W/N stoichiometry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> A 1:2 W/N stoichiometry is unlikely because the WN 2 structure is very unstable. The tungsten nitride crystal structure consists of a face centered cubic (fcc) sublattice of W atoms. Half of the octahedral holes are filled with N atoms in the W 2 N structure. All of the octahedral are filled with N atoms in the WN structure. These arrangements produce a cubic crystal lattice for W 2 N and a hexagonal lattice structure for WN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> The cubic crystal lattice for W 2 N is the most stable structure and is almost always observed in tungsten nitride film growth studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> The heat of formation of Ϫ5.3 kcal/mol for W 2 N is slightly more exothermic than the heat of formation of Ϫ3.6 kcal/mol for WN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The XRD measurements of the tungsten nitride films revealed mainly cubic W 2 N with a dominant (111) peak. The lattice constant derived from the (111) peak was ϳ2.4 Å. This lattice constant agrees with the tungsten nitride growth rate of 2.55 Å/AB cycle obtained from the measurements shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. The grain size of the tungsten nitride films was estimated to be ϳ110 Å from the (111) diffraction peak. These X-ray results indicate that the tungsten nitride films have not developed a large grain crystallized structure. The AFM measurements shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> may be observing some small crystallites on the tungsten nitride surface that are consistent with the XRD results. Small crystalline grains are commonly observed in tungsten nitride films grown at low temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The 3:1 W/N stoichiometry determined by the XPS sputter depth-profiling measurements is in disagreement with the XRD analysis that indicated a W 2 N film stoichiometry. Similar disagreement has been observed in other tungsten nitride film growth studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> These studies have also observed W 2 N by XRD and measured either higher or lower W/N stoichiometry by Ar ϩ sputter profiling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Ar ϩ ion beam sputtering usually results in preferential removal of N atoms that yields artificially high W:N ratios. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Extra N atoms are also believed to exist at grain boundaries between tungsten nitride crystallites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> These extra N atoms at the grain boundaries are not observed by the XRD experiment and may contribute to a lower W:N ratio measured during sputter depth-profiling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The atomic layer deposition of tungsten nitride films was demonstrated using self-limiting sequential surface reactions. Alternating exposures of NH 3 and WF 6 in an ABAB… reaction sequence were used to deposit the tungsten nitride films. Transmission FTIR spectroscopy studies indicated that the NH 3 and WF 6 surface reactions were complete and self-limiting at T Ն 600 K. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements determined that the tungsten nitride growth per AB cycle was extremely linear with growth rates of ϳ2.5 Å/AB cycle at 600-800 K.</p><p>AFM images revealed that the deposited tungsten nitride films were exceptionally flat with a roughness similar to the initial surface. XRD experiments revealed the films consisted of small W 2 N crystallites with a diameter ϳ110 Å and a preferred (111) orientation. XPS depth-profiling measurements of the tungsten nitride films observed only low C, O, and F impurity concentrations. The atomic layer deposition of smooth tungsten nitride films should find many applications and may be particularly important as a diffusion barrier for Cu on contact and via holes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
