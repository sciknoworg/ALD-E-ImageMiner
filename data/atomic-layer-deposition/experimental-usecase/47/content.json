Advancements in this area, pertaining to materials chemistry, test the requirements of ultra- thin film processing of insulating binary or higher order oxides, devoid of impurity atoms (e.g. halides) [1]. The numerous attributes of these layers (thinness, conformal coverage, compatibility with terminated silicon surfaces, abrupt interfaces, thermal processing, etc.) necessitate both new material developments as well as novel deposition techniques. Concerning the former, various Group III oxides are currently being explored, from  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  to its heavier congeners  $\\mathrm{Ln}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  (lanthanide $^{3 + }$  ions). For the latter one promising growth method is atomic layer deposition (ALD) whose layer- by- layer, self- terminating mechanisms ideally offer exquisite control over thin film thickness, interfaces, stoichiometry, and surface roughness to mention only a few possible advantages [6,7].",

Although the desired properties of ALD precursors remain debatable [7], each source must be volatile and show appropriate reactivity at the growth surface. Furthermore, liquid or gaseous sources offer certain industrial and academic advantages. For example, liquids often exhibit weaker intermolecular forces than solids, suggesting higher volatility, and always provide constant surface areas minimizing changes in vapor flux over time and are easier to handle and transfer. Although numerous alumina source molecules have been evaluated,  $\\mathrm{Al}_2(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_6$  (and select hydrides) is the most common starting material [3- 5,8,9]. However, as a hypergolic gas it is not without drawbacks most important industrially are its dangerous, explosive properties.

The preparation of  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  uses inexpensive  $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_4$  as the aluminum source whereas  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  employs the alane,  $\\mathrm{AlH}_3 \\cdot \\mathrm{NMe}_3$ . The purpose of these routes was to ultimately reduce contamination and charge carriers in the derived dielectric layer [1]. From the atmospheric pressure thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. 2) both precursors evaporate with onset temperatures of  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  and  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for 1 and 2, respectively. Although counterintuitive since 1 is a liquid, it is believed to exist as a dimer in this phase but evaporates as the monomer requiring more energy to break its dimeric structure [10,15,17]. This is unlike 2 which exists as a monomer, in both the solid and vapor phase [12]. The TGA data also supports nearly complete evaporation with little residue at ambient pressure and a  $50 \\mathrm{cc}$ $\\mathrm{N}_2$  flow.  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  leaves less than  $4\\%$  residue while under identical conditions  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  has an initially higher residual of  $\\sim 10\\%$ .

From these data TMA is significantly more volatile than both  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  and  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$ , however  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  is one to two orders of magnitude more volatile than  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  in the high  $(>70^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  and low temperature  $(< 70^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  regimes, respectively. At higher temperatures these values become less disparate but do not cross; thus 2 is always more volatile than 1. Surprisingly both TMA and  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  are liquids and dinuclear, making them structurally and chemically similar. From this observation we postulate that the greater vapor pressure of  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  over  $\\mathrm{Al(DEA)_3}$  is due to its mononuclear character.
