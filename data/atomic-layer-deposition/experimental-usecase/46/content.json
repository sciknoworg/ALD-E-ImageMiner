        "text": "In order to continue complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) development beyond the  $22~\\mathrm{nm}$  node, alternative channel materials in combination with high dielectric constant  $(k)$  gate layers are currently under investigation. One of these approaches is to use high- mobility III- V materials such as InGaAs and GaAs as channel layers.1- 6 High mobility substrates offer the potential for increased transconductance at reduced voltages, increasing performance at supply voltages.  $\\leq 1\\mathrm{V}$ . However, a significant factor which has inhibited the use of such materials is the lack of stable, high quality gate insulators on III- V channels. A gate oxide is required with high dielectric constant and sufficiently low density of interface states to avoid Fermi level pinning at the interface with the III- V substrate. As atomic layer deposition (ALD) of high-  $k$  dielectrics on Si is becoming a reality in manufactured devices, recent research is investigating this approach for use in III- V based devices.7,8 A number of groups have also investigated surface passivation of the  $\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1 - x}\\mathrm{As}$  substrate prior to oxide deposition.9- 11 In situ gaseous passivation is preferable to ex situ aqueous techniques which are more likely to introduce contaminants such as C, Na, and heavy metals, as well as increasing InGaAs surface roughness. In addition, both ALD and MOVPE are more attractive techniques than MBE for use in manufacturing technology. In this letter, we evaluate an in situ passivation performed at the end of the MOVPE growth of high indium content lattice matched  $\\mathrm{In}_{0.53}\\mathrm{Ga}_{0.47}\\mathrm{As}$  grown on InP substrates. The technique is based on the exposure of the  $\\mathrm{In}_{0.53}\\mathrm{Ga}_{0.47}\\mathrm{As}$  surface to  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  at the end of the growth process, prior to gate dielectric formation. The approach is particularly suited to MOVPE III- V growth as  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  is used as a  $n$ - type dopant source for InGaAs. The gate oxide employed in this work is ALD grown  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  using the metal organic precursor  $\\mathrm{Hf[N(CH_3)_2]_4}$ .12",

XPS spectra of the As  $3d$  core level for the unpassivated and passivated samples are shown in Fig. 1(b). This XPS peak is selected to examine the effect of the passivation on suppressing native oxide growth due to the large chemical shift between the As  $3d$  peak and that of the arsenic oxide.

The device fabricated on the  $50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  in situ passivated surface  $(50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  device) displays the highest maximum capacitance in accumulation  $(C_{\\mathrm{max}})$  and also exhibits the sharpest transition from depletion to accumulation. The inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the current density- voltage  $(JV)$  characteristics for unpassivated and in situ passivated MOS structures. All structures exhibit low leakage current density  $(\\sim 5\\times 10^{- 7}\\mathrm{A / cm}^2$  at  $V_{\\mathrm{fb}} + 1\\mathrm{V})$  demonstrating that these ALD  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  films on InGaAs are highly insulating.

Figure 2(b) shows multifequency  $CV$  curves measured over the range of  $1\\mathrm{kHz} - 1\\mathrm{MHz}$  for the  $50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  device. The low frequency  $CV$  behavior observed in the  $1\\mathrm{kHz}$  curve has been reported previously in narrow bandgap materials.

These levels of frequency dispersion and hysteresis are to be expected as no postdeposition thermal anneal was performed on these MOS structures. The fact that the  $50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  passivated device, which XPS showed to have no detectable S signal at the surface, displays the best electrical properties is further evidence that S is not the primary passivating element for the in situ process. It is possible to speculate that hydrogen may be passivating the InGaAs surface. One possibility is low temperature dissociative adsorption of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  to produce  $\\mathrm{H} - \\mathrm{S}$  and  $\\mathrm{H}$  species which may bond to As at the epitaxial layer surface. This has been observed in previous studies of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  treatment of  $\\mathrm{GaAs}(001)$ . In addition, the fact that H species formed on the surface by  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  dissociation will be in equilibrium with the  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  MOVPE carrier gas may assist in allowing H passivation to occur by reducing hydrogen desorption from the surface. The possibility that hydrogen passivation occurs in this process is subject to further investigation.",
