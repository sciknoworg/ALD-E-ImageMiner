The line chart illustrates the relationship between applied voltage and loss tangent across three different BST-based structures: BST/MgO (Reference), BST/TiO2/Si, and BST/Ta2O5/Si. The BST/MgO structure shows a minimal increase in loss tangent with increasing voltage, while the BST/TiO2/Si and BST/Ta2O5/Si structures exhibit more pronounced increases.
