The SEM images compare the surface morphology of Co layers deposited using Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PE-ALD) techniques on Si(001) substrates. The PVD Co layer exhibits a fringe-like pattern indicative of a textured surface, while the PE-ALD Co layer appears smoother with no visible fringes.
