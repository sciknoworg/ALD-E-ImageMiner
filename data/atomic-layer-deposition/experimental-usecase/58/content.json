        "text": "One of the plausible reasons for  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  interlayer formation during the PE- ALD Co is a direct exposure of Si substrate by  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  plasma at initial deposition cycles. In fact, the nitridation process using  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  plasma has been investigated for various applications in microelectronics technology. To estimate the  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  formation in our experimental conditions, the Si(001) substrates were exposed to  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  plasma at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . A few nanometer thick  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  film formation was confirmed by spectroscopic ellipsometer.

In our case, however, Co films were deposited by PE- ALD using  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  plasma without nucleation delay on Si as well as on  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ . This behavior can be explained by the formation of  $\\mathrm{SiN}_x$  on the Si surface by  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  plasma during the initial deposition cycles, which enables the nucleation of Co film and leads to nonselectivity in deposition.",
