        "text": "Temperature dependence.- Figure 4 shows the growth per cycle for the three processes over a wide temperature range. The thermal ALD Pt process has a temperature window starting at  $\\sim 200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  The fact that the growth per cycle is reduced at lower substrate temperatures is not yet understood.21 From surface science studies, it can be inferred that the dissociative chemisorption of  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  [on  $\\mathrm{Pt(111)}]$  should not be the limiting factor.12 On the other hand, the remote plasma ALD process which uses atomic oxygen from the gas phase has a higher growth rate than the thermal process at  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  The higher resistivity  $(\\sim 500\\mu \\Omega \\mathrm{cm})$  found for this temperature, however, suggests incomplete removal of O and C impurities from the material. The poorer material properties could be overcome by an  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  plasma treatment. Exposure of the film to  $300\\mathrm{~s~H_2}$  plasma at  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  reduced the resistivity to  $61\\mu \\Omega \\mathrm{cm}$  .Moreover, tests with an ALD cycle containing a  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  gas exposure step (no plasma power applied) of  $2\\mathrm{~s~}$  after the  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma step resulted in excellent materials properties for  $\\mathrm{Pt}$  at  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (mass density of  $19.8\\mathrm{~g~cm}^{- 3}$  no C and O impurities detected, and a resistivity of  $19\\mu \\Omega$  cm at  $22~\\mathrm{nm}$  film thickness). These results demonstrate that the temperature window for remote plasma ALD of  $\\mathrm{Pt}$  can effectively be extended down to  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  For  $\\mathrm{PtO_2}$  the growth per cycle decreases slightly with increasing substrate temperature between 100 and  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  demonstrating that this process also has a large temperature window. At the substrate temperature of  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  decomposition of  $\\mathrm{PtO_2}$  is reported to start for sputtered films, while in air decomposition starts at  $550^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  due to the higher partial pressure of oxygen.26 For the process employing  $\\mathrm{Pt(acac)_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{O_3}$  only a small temperature window was observed  $(120 - 130^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  .13 Therefore, the large temperature window of our  $\\mathrm{PtO_2}$  process suggests a higher stability of the material, which can most likely be related to the higher oxygen content  $\\mathrm{(PtO_{2.2}}$  compared to  $\\mathrm{PtO_{1.6}}$",
