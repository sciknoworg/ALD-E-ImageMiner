The chart illustrates the growth per cycle (nm/cycle) of different ALD processes (Remote plasma ALD PtO₂, Remote plasma ALD Pt, Including H₂ step, Thermal ALD Pt) at varying deposition temperatures (100°C, 200°C, 300°C). The Remote plasma ALD PtO₂ shows a slight decrease in growth rate with increasing temperature, while the Remote plasma ALD Pt and Including H₂ step maintain relatively constant growth rates. The Thermal ALD Pt exhibits a significant increase in growth rate starting at 200°C.
