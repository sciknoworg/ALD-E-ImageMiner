The chart illustrates the relationship between the SiH₄/NH₃ ratio and the Si content in at.% and film thickness per cycle in nm/cycle. As the SiH₄/NH₃ ratio increases, the Si content initially rises sharply, peaks around 10⁻¹ ratio, then drops off. Conversely, the film thickness per cycle decreases as the ratio increases.
