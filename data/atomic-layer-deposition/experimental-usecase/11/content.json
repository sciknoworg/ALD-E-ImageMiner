The new diffusion barrier films are required to prevent copper diffusion into the insulator, and the diffusion of impurities into the copper metal. Demanding film properties of the diffusion barrier are especially required when the films with sub- 10- nm thickness are expected in sub- 100- nm node [1]. For the manufacture of reliable devices the barrier film must exhibit excellent step coverage and uniformity. The film must be continuous over all structures and the film density must not vary on the sidewalls of vias or trenches. The resistivity should be below 500  $\\mu \\Omega$  cm and free carbon or halide residues from the precursors should be minimal. The processing must meet several requirements including processing temperatures below  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , good growth, and adhesion to the different surface materials present in the dual- damascene structure. The film also has to be compatible with the chemical mechanical polishing process.",

Because the grain size is very small in thin films, the density of boundaries is relatively high. Grain boundary diffusion has been found to dominate over lattice and dislocation diffusion under nearly all conditions [2]. In general, amorphous structure can be achieved at low deposition temperature. Unfortunately, the film properties strongly depend on the deposition temperature, and the lower the temperature is used the worse are the film properties. To obtain reasonable film properties, the deposition temperature must usually be so high that polycrystalline film growth takes place. Typically, polycrystalline metal nitride films have columnar grain structure as a consequence of the limited mobility of the deposited atoms. The columnar growth takes place at the very beginning of the film growth, and the grain boundaries, which are between 5 and  $15\\mathrm{\\AA}$  wide, can be observed throughout the film.",

The self- saturation offers superior via/trench filling capabilities and makes it possible to deposit highly uniform films over large substrate areas. ALD has proved itself the ultimate method to prepare transition metal nitride films with close to bulk density [4]. Because of the high density, these films could be expected to be very good diffusion barriers for copper metallization. Nevertheless, in most studies so far the films have been found to be polycrystalline and to exhibit grain boundaries [5- 9]. Although there is no proof yet that grain boundaries are responsible for the diffusion problem in the film, the boundaries are clearly a factor for unreliability in regard to the diffusion barrier properties. In view of this, one of the objectives of our present work was to deposit nanolaminate film stacks consisting of multiple thin films and constructed so as to create highly complicated diffusion paths for impurities. In the nanolaminates, continuous grain boundaries are avoided by successively depositing thin films of different materials. Mismatch of the grain boundaries can be increased by utilizing materials, which have very different lattice parameters. Grain boundary formation can also be diminished by depositing very thin layers. Then the grain growth will be disturbed and the grain boundary formation will remain weak.",

Even though TiN film was found to have appropriate properties for use as a barrier film in copper dual- damascene structures, its incompatibility with copper presents a challenge in copper metallization. We deposited  $\\mathrm{WN}_x\\mathrm{C}_y$  films of different thickness between the TiN film and the copper substrate to determinate an appropriate thickness for avoiding the copper pitting. Fig. 5 shows that when the  $\\mathrm{WN}_x\\mathrm{C}_y$  film is approximately 40- Å- thick, no copper pitting occurs after TiN deposition. The pitting phenomenon gradually began to appear with thinner  $\\mathrm{WN}_x\\mathrm{C}_y$  films.",
