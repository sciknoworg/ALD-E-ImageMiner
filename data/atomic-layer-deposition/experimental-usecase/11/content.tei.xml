<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Copper dual-damascene processes are a new technology in the IC industry creating new challenges for conventional metallization processes. The new diffusion barrier films are required to prevent copper diffusion into the insulator, and the diffusion of impurities into the copper metal. Demanding film properties of the diffusion barrier are especially required when the films with sub-10-nm thickness are expected in sub-100-nm node w1x. For the manufacture of reliable devices the barrier film must exhibit excellent step coverage and uniformity. The film must be continuous over all structures and the film density must not vary on the sidewalls of vias or trenches. The resistivity should be below 500 mV cm and free carbon or halide residues from the precursors should be minimal. The processing must meet several requirements including processing temperatures below 400 8C, good growth, and adhesion to the different surface materials present in the dual-damascene structure. The film also has to be compatible with the chemical mechanical polishing process.</p><p>The best diffusion barrier properties will be obtained with an amorphous film, given that the grain boundaries in polycrystalline film are the most probable diffusion path for impurities. Because the grain size is very small in thin films, the density of boundaries is relatively high. Grain boundary diffusion has been found to dominate over lattice and dislocation diffusion under nearly all conditions w2x. In general, amorphous structure can be achieved at low deposition temperature. Unfortunately, the film properties strongly depend on the deposition temperature, and the lower the temperature is used the worse are the film properties. To obtain reasonable film properties, the deposition temperature must usually be so high that polycrystalline film growth takes place. Typically, polycrystalline metal nitride films have columnar grain structure as a consequence of the limited mobility of the deposited atoms. The columnar growth takes place at the very beginning of the film growth, and the grain boundaries, which are between 5 and 15 A wide, can be observed throughout the film.</p><p>In the present work all films were deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, a method based on sequential self-saturated surface reactions, which lead to controlled layer-by-layer growth of thin film w3x. The self-saturation offers superior viaytrench filling capabilities and makes it possible to deposit highly uniform films over large substrate areas. ALD has proved itself the ultimate method to prepare transition metal nitride films with close to bulk density w4x. Because of the high density, these films could be expected to be very good diffusion barriers for copper metallization. Nevertheless, in most studies so far the films have been found to be polycrystalline and to exhibit grain boundaries w5-9x. Although there is no proof yet that grain boundaries are responsible for the diffusion problem in the film, the boundaries are clearly a factor for unreliability in regard to the diffusion barrier properties. In view of this, one of the objectives of our present work was to deposit nanolaminate film stacks consisting of multiple thin films and constructed so as to create highly complicated diffusion paths for impurities. In the nanolaminates, continuous grain boundaries are avoided by successively depositing thin films of different materials. Mismatch of the grain boundaries can be increased by utilizing materials, which have very different lattice parameters. Grain boundary formation can also be diminished by depositing very thin layers. Then the grain growth will be disturbed and the grain boundary formation will remain weak.</p><p>Our previous studies revealed a serious incompatibility to deposit TiN or W N films on the copper metal x w10x. Marked copper pitting occurred during the deposition, probably caused by reaction by-products. Furthermore, the W N film suffered from relatively high x resistivity, which reduces its usefulness as a diffusion barrier film. Ways of avoiding the problems of polycrystallinity and grain boundary diffusion mentioned above, and the problems of incompatibility with copper and high resistivity, we sought in the present investigations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental details</head><p>The barrier depositions were made using ASM Microchemistry's commercial flow-type single wafer reactor, PULSAR 2000, which has been optimized for Atomic ᭨ Layer CVD (ALCVD) processes. The operating pressure was kept below 10 mbar with the balance of a dry pump (Alcatel ADP 122P) and a continuous nitrogen flow (400 sccm). After reactive filtering of the nitrogen purge gas in the front of the reactor, the impurity concentration of the nitrogen is at ppb level. A wafer size of 200 mm was used in the experiments. TiN films were deposited using TiCl and ammonia 4 (NH ) as precursors. TiCl (99%, Fluka) evaporated at 3 4 room temperature (21 8C) was pulsed onto the substrate using nitrogen as carrier gas (400 sccm). Ammonia Because no further heating or cooling was required, it was very easy to use this precursor in the ALD process. Copper metal compatibility studies were made on blanket wafers coated with 1-mm-thick electrochemically deposited (ECD) copper film. Under the ECD copper there was a 150-nm-thick PVD copper seed layer and a thin TaN film. The four-point resistivity measurements were made with a commercial Jandel four-point probe. The film thickness, impurities and the pitting pictures were characterized with a Link ISIS energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer connected to a Zeiss DMS 962 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM pictures of the copper surfaces were taken with a Philips XL30 SEM. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) picture of the W NyTiN stack was taken with an FEI Tecnai 12</p><p>x working at 120 kV acceleration voltages. The crosssection was cut from foils, embedded in epoxy, with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome. TEM cross-section pictures of TiN film and WN C yTiN film stack were x y obtained with a Philips CM30 operating at 200 kV acceleration voltages. The Auger analysis of the nanolaminate structure was done with a Scanning Auger Microprobe PHI-4300. Thermodynamic calculations were made using the software of HSC CHEMISTRY 4.1 for Windows (Outokumpu Research Oy).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Deposition of TiN</head><p>The growth rate of TiN was 0.17 A per cycle at 400 8C. The film quality was excellent: chlorine residues were as low as 1.2 at.%, step coverage was superior, and resistivity was below 200 mV cm w10x. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts a cross-section of TiN film where the grain size Fig. 3. Fluorine content between 225 and 400 8C. narrow grain boundaries. This suggests that TiN film deposited by ALD could exhibit good barrier film properties for copper metallization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Deposition of W N and WN C x x y</head><p>In earlier work w10x, we deposited tungsten nitride film with tungsten hexafluoride and ammonia as precursors. A growth rate as high as 0.4 A per cycle was åchieved at 400 8C. The films were polycrystalline, however, as were TiN films, exhibiting columnar grain structure. Even though the fluorine concentration in the film was only 2.4 at.%, the resistivity was as high as 4500 mV cm, which is far beyond the acceptable range for copper metallization. We suspected that the oxidation state of the tungsten in tungsten nitride was too high. Achieving lower resistivity evidently requires a stronger reducing agent than ammonia.</p><p>The insufficient reducing capability of ammonia is well known and has been demonstrated in related studies w5,6,8x. There are two major approaches to improving the reduction of a metal precursor: (1) use a more reductive nitrogen precursor such as dimethylhydrazine w7x or plasma-enhanced radicals (NH ) w11x, (2) 3yx introduce of a third precursor, which is pulsed either between the metal and the nitrogen precursor or after the nitrogen precursor. Such precursors as zinc metal w5,6x and trimethylaluminum (Al(CH ) ) w12x have been 3 3 successfully used as reducing agents in transition metal nitride depositions.</p><p>We chose to introduce a third precursor. Tungsten nitride carbide (WN C ) film was deposited utilizing x y triethylboron as reducing agent for tungsten and gettering agent for halogens where the two other precursors were WF and NH . A self-saturated growth mechanism 6 3 was achieved below 350 8C. At higher deposition temperature the triethylboron decomposed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> depicts a characteristic ALD curve where the thickness is in linear relationship to the number of deposition cycles. These depositions were made at 350 8C and the cycle time was less than 4.5 s. The growth rate of the film is approximately 0.8 A per cycle and it remains almost constant from 300 to 350 8C indicating the 'ALD window' w13x. XPS analysis revealed the composition W:N:Cf55:15:30 where the N:C ratio varied slightly with the pulse lengths of ammonia and triethylboron w14x. Boron residues were below the detection limit of 0.5 at.%. The fluorine concentration was also very low. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> depicts the fluorine concentration between 225 and 400 8C. (Without triethylboron the fluorine concentration in the W N film was 2.4 at.% when the film was x deposited at 400 8C). Because the film was exposed to air, oxygen residues were detected on the surface. The oxygen content in the bulk film was below 1 at.%. XRD analysis suggests the form in which carbon exists in the film. The WN C film is evidently nanocrystalline and x y the most probable crystalline phase is cubic WC 1yx w14x. Also, very low resistivity, as low as 210 mV cm, indicates that the carbon does not behave in the film as a harmful impurity. Possibly all the carbon is bound in the form of metal carbide.</p><p>As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, and unlike in our previous studies, the growth of WN C film did not cause pitting x y on the copper surface. WN C film also exhibited good x y copper compatibility, with excellent adhesion to copper. The film passed the scotch tape test; when the wafer was cut into pieces, the film peeled off from the copper seed interface rather than the barrier film.</p><p>In our previous study w10x, marked copper pitting was found in both W N and TiN depositions. Most likely x the pitting was due to the reaction by-products of the film deposition rather than to the precursors themselves. It was speculated then that hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) by-products might react with the copper surface causing the pitting. Eq.

Even though TiN film was found to have appropriate properties for use as a barrier film in copper dual-damascene structures, its incompatibility with copper presents a challenge in copper metallization. We deposited WN C</p><p>x y films of different thickness between the TiN film and the copper substrate to determinate an appropriate thickness for avoiding the copper pitting.

At this temperature the film contained 2.6 at.% fluorine and 2.4 at.% chlorine. The higher deposition temperature could be utilized because triethylboron was not used. When the deposition temperature was raised to 400 8C, the resistivity of the stack dropped to 360 mV cm, which is surprisingly low considering the resistivity of W N x (4500 mV cm) w10x. The fluorine and chlorine residues were 2.3 and 1.0 at.%, respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref> depicts the nanolaminate film stack of (9=(WN C (2 nm)qTiN (2 nm))). Clearly, it is x y difficult to draw conclusions approximately grain boundaries on the basis of this picture, even though the layers are clearly visible.
