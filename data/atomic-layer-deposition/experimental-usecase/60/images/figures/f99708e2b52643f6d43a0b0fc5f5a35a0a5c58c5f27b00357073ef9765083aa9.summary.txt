The graph illustrates the growth per cycle (GPC) of different materials under various plasma conditions at varying substrate temperatures. The materials include H₂O plasma, O₂ plasma, H₂O, and Y(EtCp)(iPr-amd) without reactant. As the substrate temperature increases, the GPC generally rises for all materials, with H₂O plasma showing the highest GPC values.
