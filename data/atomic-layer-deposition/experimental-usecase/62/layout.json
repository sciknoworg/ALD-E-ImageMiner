The species in the plasma can be identified through the analysis of the light emitted by the plasma. OES provides therefore information on the reactant species delivered to the surface by the plasma but it also yields unique insight into the surface reaction products and, as a consequence, on the reaction mechanisms of the deposition process. Time- resolved measurements reveal information about the amount of precursor dosing and length of plasma exposure needed to saturate the self- limiting half reactions, which is useful for the optimization of the ALD process. Furthermore, time- resolved OES can also be used as an easy- to- implement process monitoring tool for plasma- assisted ALD processes on production equipment; for example, to monitor reactor wall conditions or to detect process faults in real time. © 2010 American Vacuum Society."

A trend that started half a decade ago and that is currently gaining more momentum is the introduction of a plasma step in the ALD process. This so- called plasma- enhanced or plasma- assisted ALD process has several potential advantages compared to the purely thermally driven process, often referred to as thermal ALD. For some (emerging) applications of ultrathin films, merits of plasma- assisted ALD such as the deposition at reduced temperatures, improved material properties, increased choice of precursors and materials, and more process versatility might become of key importance."

Plasma- assisted ALD of a large set of materials has already been reported, however, many questions about the reaction mechanisms that rule the surface chemistry and the resulting film and device properties still remain unanswered. Moreover, with plasma- assisted ALD gradually developing to research and development (R&D) and industrial applications, there is a need for process monitoring tools and process control tools which are dedicated to the plasma- based process. The aforementioned issues can be tackled by the implementation of in situ diagnostic techniques: in situ studies are of key importance for elucidating the reaction mechanisms of plasma- assisted ALD, and, if easy to implement, the techniques can also serve as process "

This is helpful to decrease precursor consumption and to increase wafer throughput. Finally, we will show that OES is an easy- to- implement technique for process monitoring and process control on"

OES is therefore well suited to monitor several aspects of the deposition process, such as plasma source operation, adequacy of purging, reactor wall conditioning, etc."

It is not the intention to give a complete and detailed review of the method and its results; we rather want to demonstrate to the (nonplasma specialist) reader that very valuable information can easily be obtained by the OES method. We start therefore with a brief review of the very basics of OES in Sec. II, after which some experimental details will be presented (Sec. III). In Sec. IV, emission spectra of several plasmas typically employed in plasma- assisted ALD will first be treated with the most prominent emission lines identified. Although specific for the particular plasmas studied, the results should form a good starting point when other plasma configurations and other plasma conditions are considered. Subsequently, examples of OES results will be presented for a variety of plasma- assisted ALD processes "

Emission lines in an emission spectrum originate from the decay of electronically excited states of the atoms and molecules which are present in the reactor. These excited states are in most cases created through collisions between plasma species with electrons, for example, through electron- impact excitation, ionization, or dissociation reactions. Radiating atomic, ionic, and molecular species can therefore reveal information on the species present in the plasma and consequently also about the reactions that take place in the gas phase and at the surface of the reactor or film deposited. The existence of particular emission lines in the emission spectrum indicates the presence of particular species in the plasma, i.e., the emission lines can act as a \"fingerprint\" of (excited) species. We note, however, that it cannot be concluded that certain species are absent in the plasma when their emission lines are not observed. Whether species radiate depends on whether the species are excited in the plasma and therefore details of the plasma kinetics as well as details of the electronic structure and radiative properties of the species are important."

The latter, however, only holds when the excited state is predominantly populated through excitations from the ground state, referred to as the so- called Corona balance, which is generally the case in ionizing plasmas. Moreover, the intensity of a certain emission line can only be directly related to the density of a certain ground state species when one particular excitation channel is present or by far dominant. However, in several cases there exist several excitation channels, for example, involving both atomic and molecular species in the plasma, that can contribute to the population of an excited state. It should also be noted that the fraction of the plasma species which are electronically excited in an ionizing plasma is determined by the electron energy distribution function of the plasma, resulting in a dependence of the emission intensity on both the density of the plasma species and the energy distribution function of the electrons. Since both can change when the plasma conditions are varied (i.e., actively varied or altered by indirect means), the change in density of plasma species cannot be determined straightforwardly from optical emission signals. This problem can be solved by using the method of actinometry as developed by Coburn and Chen. More detailed theory of OES can be found in Refs. 21- 23 and references therein."

Deposition of thin film material on this window is negligible because the valve between the deposition chamber and the plasma source is closed during the precursor exposure step for most ALD processes. The optical fiber can also be placed in front of a window installed on a vacuum port in the downstream region of the reactor, as shown in Fig. 1(b). This position samples the downstream plasma and is expected to give preferential information on the excited reaction product species. On the other hand, the plasma is less intense at this position and the opening angle of the vacuum port is small reducing the emission intensities detected. Furthermore, thin film material will be deposited at this window and therefore the optical transmission of this window should be closely monitored over time. Measurements on the ALD- I reactor have been carried out in the downstream region through glass and quartz windows positioned in the reactor chamber. The fiber probes light emitted by the plasma at the position of the substrate stage. For the ALD- I reactor it is also possible to detect the light emission in the plasma source region by positioning the quartz fiber in front of the quartz tube used to generate the inductively coupled plasma."

See, for example, Fig. 3. When the precursor exposure step has preceded the plasma exposure step, the optical emission signals at the start of the plasma step are remarkably different from a plasma exposure step which is not related to an ALD cycle (e.g., just by switching the plasma on and off). The behavior distinguishes itself from typical plasma start- up effects by the fact that the initial change over time is much more prominent"

This difference in plasma emission results from the reactions at the surface that are initiated by the plasma species. When delivered to the surface these reactant species react with the precursor fragments adsorbed at the surface during the precursor dosing step. Volatile reaction products are released from the surface into the plasma and when excited by, e.g., electron impact, the reaction products provide additional optical emission at certain wavelengths. This additional emission yields information about the kind of reaction products created at the start of the plasma exposure and consequently about the surface reactions. Moreover, consumption of reactant species in the plasma by these surface reactions can be observed by a reduced optical emission intensity at wavelengths that correspond to the plasma reactant species itself. At the end of the plasma step when the surface reactions have saturated, the emission spectrum recorded during a plasma- assisted ALD cycle resembles the spectrum of the steady- state plasma."

Studies by OES help therefore to come to an understanding of the reaction mechanisms of plasma- assisted ALD processes."

From time- resolved OES measurements such as in Figs. 3(b), 4(b), and 5(b), the minimal plasma exposure needed to achieve ALD growth conditions can easily be determined. Since the emission lines corresponding to the reaction products and consumed reactant species are a direct evidence of plasma interaction with the surface ligands, their time- resolved signals reveal when the surface reactions have reached completion. When the signals reach their steady- state value, it is safe to assume that the surface ligand exchange is finished. For example, the optical emission signals in Fig. 3(b) reach their steady- state value after approximately "

In the case that not all internal surfaces of a reactor have the same temperature, the plasma emission results can be an average over different saturation coverages of the surfaces, e.g., when the growth per cycle is significantly affected by the substrate temperature. Still the results from the emission intensities might yield good first order estimates for the plasma exposure time and the amount of precursor dosing necessary."

I, there is a need for dedicated process monitoring tools when plasma- assisted ALD processes develop to (industrial) applications. Generally many quality measurements are done ex situ by postprocess analysis of wafers, however, in situ process monitoring can give already a lot of information about the deposition process itself. The use of process monitoring tools can improve uptime by detecting equipment failure and reduce the amount of test wafers needed. Process monitoring tools can also be used to monitor process drifts and contribute to the improvement of wafer- to- wafer reproducibility, etc. OES is a suitable candidate for process monitoring due to its advantages such as the low investment costs, the easiness of implementation, and the ability to measure real time and noninvasively. Compared to other techniques, OES has the advantage of a very low detection limit (e.g., compared to mass spectrometry), while the measurement procedure is relatively simple in comparison with advanced optical spectroscopy (e.g., compared to infrared spectroscopy or laser induced fluorescence). On the other hand, with OES only excited species are probed and insight into absolute densities can only be obtained by applying indirect methods such as actinometry. The merits of OES have already been realized a long time ago in the field of plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition and especially in the field of plasma etching. In plasma etching OES is often employed for fault detection as well as for end point detection.35,36"

Obviously, OES provides the possibility of both real- time fault detection and postdeposition fault detection by logging the optical emission signals during the deposition. The latter can, for example, be useful when the wafer quality does not correspond to the specifications, potentially due to a process fault. One step more advanced is to implement advanced process control (APC),37 in which the process monitoring tool helps to control the equipment. The signals obtained are compared to the desired signals and the difference is a measure for a possible correction by the equipment to reach the targeted effect. Due to the very high time resolution of the technique, OES is also very well suited for such APC features and it can therefore prevent unsuccessful depositions or equipment downtime through the detection and correction of process faults during the deposition process."

An example of a reactor wall conditioning procedure is the exposure of the reactor walls to a plasma for a preset time. Such plasma exposure can remove and dissociate surface groups and reaction products accumulated on the surface. Insight into the reactor wall conditions can be obtained with optical emission spectroscopy39,40 since small amounts of (contaminant) species in the plasma can already result in emission intensities that can be measured with a good signal- to- noise ratio."
