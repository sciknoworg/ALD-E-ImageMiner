The thermal behavior of both compounds was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and they were both found to be reasonably volatile compounds. Compound 1 had no residual mass in the TGA and showed long- term stability at temperatures as high as  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , while 2 had a residual mass of  $7.4\\%$ . Copper metal with good resistivity was deposited using 1 by plasma- enhanced atomic layer deposition. The precursor demonstrated self- limiting behavior indicative of ALD, and gave a growth rate of  $0.2\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle. Compound 2 was unsuccessful as an ALD precursor under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations showed that both compounds adsorb dissociatively onto a growing copper film as long as there is some atomic roughness, via cleavage of the Cu- carbene bond.",

        "text": "ALD has been proposed as an alternative method to CVD for depositing conformal, ultrathin films at comparatively lower temperatures. ALD is similar to CVD except that the substrate is sequentially exposed to one reactant at a time, or one dose of a reactant at a time. Conceptually, it is a simple process: a first reactant is introduced to a heated substrate whereby it forms a monolayer on the surface of the substrate. Excess reactant is pumped out (e.g, evacuated). Next a second reactant is introduced and reacts with the existing monolayer to form a submonolayer of a desired reaction product through a self- limiting surface reaction. The process is self- limiting since the deposition reaction halts once the initially adsorbed (phys- isorbed or chemisorbed) monolayer of the first reactant has fully reacted with the second reactant. Finally, the excess second reactant is evacuated. This sequence constitutes one deposition cycle. The desired film thickness is obtained by repeating deposition cycles as necessary. As is apparent, the sequential layer- by- layer nature of ALD has the disadvantage of being slower than some other deposition techniques. However it is this cycle of building up highly uniform layers one at a time that allows ALD to produce films of a surface uniformity, smoothness, and thinness that is impossible to achieve with other techniques. This makes ALD uniquely valuable in demanding coating applications. In the specific application of ALD used for this study, the \"second reactant\" in this case is a hydrogen plasma, generated remotely from the growing surface from dihydrogen carried by argon. This plasma is screened by a grounded grid, filtering out ions from the plasma, and permitting only the radicals (and light) produced in the plasma to impinge on the surface. The role of the hydrogen plasma is to scour off the ligand system, as well as reducing the copper surface species to metal. Given the complex nature of the plasma, the mechanistic reaction at the surface is likely complex. An excellent review of plasma ALD processes can be found here.",

        "text": "It is interesting that copper amides have not been prevalent precursors for ALD. It is known that copper(I) amides typically produce a tetrameric structure, and copper(I) amides are more thermally stabile than alkyl or alkoxo species. Thus, it has been difficult to isolate a thermally stable copper amide precursor that exhibits sufficient volatility to be considered for CVD or ALD. However, monomeric copper(I) species are well- studied in catalysis. Specifically, copper(I) NHCs are well- known to exhibit good thermal stability during  $\\mathrm{C - H}$  bond activation and can drastically increase the thermal stability in sensitive  $\\mathrm{Cu(I)}$  species. Thus, the synthesis and thermal characterization of copper(I) amides stabilized by NHCs was undertaken to examine their suitability as ALD precursors. This design strategy is common for group 11 precursors, and recent success has been shown for the plasma enhanced ALD of Ag films.",

Preliminary screening showed backbone substitution of imidazolin- 2- ylidenes proved to be unnecessary as such NHCs afforded copper compounds with sufficient thermal stability.
