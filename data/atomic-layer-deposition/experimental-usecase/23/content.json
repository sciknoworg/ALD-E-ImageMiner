We evaluated a variety of oxygen sources for  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  ALD using TMGa but found that only ozone was effective. We explored the mechanism for  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  ALD using in situ quartz crystal microbalance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and quadrupole mass spectrometry studies. We found that TMGa dissociatively adsorbs onto the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  surface to form  $\\mathrm{Ga}\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{2}$  surface species and liberate  $\\sim 20\\%$  of the methyl ligands as  $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ . Next, the ozone reacts with these methyl species to form hydroxyl and formate surface groups and liberate  $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ . We prepared ALD  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  films on  $\\mathrm{Si}(100)$  and fused  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  substrates and analyzed the films using a variety of techniques. We found the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  growth to be self- limiting with a growth rate of  $\\sim 0.52\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle between 200 and  $375^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Moreover, the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  films were stoichiometric, free of residual carbon, and exhibited properties similar to bulk  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ . Scanning electron microscopy revealed smooth films with good step coverage over trench structures, and X- ray diffraction showed that the films were amorphous as- deposited but crystallized to  $\\beta - \\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  upon annealing at  $900^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$",

The initial  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$  deformation feature at 1215  $\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  is actually a superposition of two peaks at 1220 and 1209  $\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ .  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  exposures remove only the peak at  $1209\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . As a result, it is the remaining  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$  groups associated with the 1220  $\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  peak that cause the surface passivation. The exact nature of these two types of  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$  groups remains unclear. One possibility is that TMGa dissociates on the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface to form dimethylgallium species and  $\\mathrm{Al - CH}_3$  species. As with conventional  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALD, the  $\\mathrm{Al - CH}_3$  bonds are easily removed by  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ , whereas the  $\\mathrm{Ga - CH}_3$  bonds persist and passivate the surface. Alternatively, in analogy with TMA adsorbed onto an  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface, the 1220 and  $1209\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  features may be associated with monomethylgallium and dimethylgallium features, respectively. As with adsorbed TMA, the dimethyl species may be more reactive and removed by the first  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  exposure, while the monomethyl species are less reactive and remain on the surface. In any case, the persistent peak at 1220  $\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  indicates that surface methyl species prevent  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALD using  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ .",

        "text": "The optical properties of the as- deposited  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films were determined using ellipsometry and optical transmittance measurements. Fitting the ellipsometric measurements from the ALD  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films using a Cauchy model provided the refractive index as a function of  $\\lambda$ $n(\\lambda) = 1.844 + 0.01249 / \\lambda^2 +$ $0.000463 / \\lambda^4$  with  $n = 1.88$  at  $589~\\mathrm{nm}$  These refractive index values are very similar to those reported for  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films prepared by other methods13,14,55 and to bulk  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  56 As shown in Figure 10, optical transmittance revealed that the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  thin films are highly transparent between 300 and 2500 nm. The optical bandgap,  $E_{\\mathrm{g'}}$  of the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  film was determined using the relationship  $\\alpha h\\nu = B(h\\nu - E_{\\mathrm{g}})^n$  where  $\\alpha$  is the absorption coefficient as a function  $\\mathrm{h}\\nu ,\\mathrm{B}$  is a constant, and n depends on the type of transition.57 For these films, the best fit is obtained with  $n = 1 / 2,$  which is consistent with a direct bandgap. The  $E_{\\mathrm{g'}}$  is determined by plotting  $(\\alpha h\\nu)^2$  versus energy and extrapolating the linear portion of the curve to zero. As shown in Figure 10b, this analysis reveals a bandgap of 4.95 eV, which is consistent with previous measurements of  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  thin films deposited using other methods and bulk  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  53 The excellent transmittance and high bandgap of the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films makes them well- suited to both TCO and phosphor applications.",

        "text": "We have demonstrated a new process for the ALD of highquality  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  thin films using TMGa and ozone. In situ QCM, FTIR, and QMS measurements revealed a growth mechanism in which TMGa dissociatively adsorbs onto the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface to form  $\\mathrm{Ga(CH}_3)_2$  surface species and liberates  $\\sim 20\\%$  of the methyl ligands as  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$  Next, the ozone reacts with these methyl species to form hydroxyl and formate surface groups and liberate  $\\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{O}$  In contrast,  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALD using TMGa and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  was not possible because the surface became poisoned by surface methyl species after only a few cycles and these methyl species could not be removed by  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  Alternating exposures to TMGa and ozone yielded a growth rate of  $0.52\\mathrm{\\AA} / \\mathrm{cycle}$  for deposition temperatures between 200 and  $375^{\\circ}C$  The  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  growth rate decreased at higher temperatures due to precursor thermal decomposition, and larger ozone exposures were required to achieve saturation at temperatures below  $300^{\\circ}C$  because of the slow ozone kinetics. Analysis of  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films deposited with the TMGa-  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  process showed that the films are stoichiometric, free of residual carbon, and possess properties similar to bulk  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  Lastly, the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALD process exhibits a temperature window that is compatible with many complementary ALD processes, which should enable various doped  $\\mathrm{Ga}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films for applications including TCOs, phosphors, and dielectrics.",
