        "text": "Due to the abundance and usefulness of tin oxide for applications such as transparent conductors, sensors, and catalysts, it is desirable to establish high quality atomic layer deposition (ALD) of this material. ALD allows for uniform, conformal coating of complex topographies with ultrathin films and can broaden the applicability of tin oxide to systems such as nanostructured solar cells. The present work examines the ALD of tin oxide by means of the precursor tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin and water as a counter- reactant. Low temperature growth in the range of  $30 - 200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  on Si(100) and glass substrates is studied. It is found that the growth rate increases with reduced temperature, up to  $\\sim 2.0\\dot{\\mathrm{A}} /$  cycle at  $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  as compared to  $0.70\\dot{\\mathrm{A}} /$  cycle at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The ALD process is established to be saturated even at the lowest temperature studied, for which the film contamination levels are below the detection limits of  $\\mathbf{X}$  - ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As- deposited films are smooth (rms roughness of  $33\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for a  $460\\mathrm{\\AA}$  thick film deposited on Si at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  and amorphous according to  $\\mathbf{X}$  - ray diffractometry. However, post- annealing to  $600^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  in nitrogen leads to the formation of polycrystalline rutile  $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$ . The optical constants obtained from variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry suggest that as- deposited films have amorphous type bandgaps, which decrease with increasing temperature and film thickness. High quality, amorphous  $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$  films with moderately tunable optical properties are thus obtained by ALD at temperatures as low as  $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  using a commercially available tin precursor and water.

Because the number of ALD cycles was fixed in this experiment, the varying growth rates (Fig. 4) means that the film thickness were higher for the lower temperatures. To investigate if the observed bandgaps and other properties depend on the film thickness, additional experiments at fixed temperature  $(150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  and a varying number of ALD cycles were performed. The results, shown in Fig. 9(d), indicate a monotonic decrease of bandgap with thickness, from  $4.4\\mathrm{eV}$  for the thinnest (approximately  $2\\mathrm{nm}$ ) film down to  $2.7\\mathrm{eV}$  for the thickest  $(20\\mathrm{nm})$  film. The film thickness dependence may therefore possibly explain the increasing trend at the highest temperatures of Fig. 9(c). Although the underlying mechanism for this thickness dependence is not yet known, we speculate that the films, rather than being purely amorphous, may form a fine- grained microstructure undetectable to XRD and with feature sizes related to the film thickness. If the grains confine the wave functions of excited states, the bandgap will be affected by their size, with smaller grains exhibiting larger bandgaps. Since the exciton Bohr radius of  $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$  quantum dots has been estimated to  $2.7\\mathrm{nm}$ , it seems feasible that effects related to quantum confinement could be observed for the range of thicknesses covered here. Similar reasoning could be used to explain the increasing bandgap at lower temperatures, where growth conditions rather than film thickness would favor smaller grain sizes and therefore higher bandgap. The minimum bandgap at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  may then plausibly be the result of a maximum grain size, for the particular situation after 200 ALD cycles. Further characterization, for instance by transmission electron microscopy, would be needed to clarify this sensitive dependence of the optical properties on film thickness and substrate temperature in  $\\mathrm{SnO_x}$  thin films. In this context, it is also noteworthy that the growth rate increases by more than a factor 2 as the substrate temperature is reduced from 100 to  $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (Fig. 4). One may suspect that a lower mobility of surface species at low temperature would lead to a more porous film, and perhaps a concomitant higher growth rate. However, as the refractive indices are essentially the same over the whole spectrum in this temperature interval [Fig. 9(a)], film porosity is unlikely to account for increased growth rate, and an explanation based on the surface coverage of hydroxyl groups, outlined above, appears more plausible.",
