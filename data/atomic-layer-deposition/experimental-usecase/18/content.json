With atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, uniform thin films deposition with excellent step- coverage could be realized over large area substrates.

        "text": "An ideal ALD film growth occurs from repetition of complementary surface reaction sequence alone with each reaction allowed to attain surface saturation. Hence, for ALD, the substrate temperature should be such that it overcomes the activation barrier for surface reaction and also prevents condensation, desorption, or thermal decomposition of the reacting molecules at the substrate surface. A sufficiently large dose of precursor and reactant molecules in the respective reactions ensures that self- limiting surface saturation is achieved. Purging of ALD reactor following every surface reaction assures that excess unreacted molecules and the reaction by- products are successfully driven out of the reactor and prevents gas phase reactions during the next reaction step. Under self- limiting growth conditions, the substrate temperature  $(\\mathrm{T_{sub}})$  and deposition cycle parameters  $(\\mathrm{t_1 - t_4})$  are such that the material growth is preferential because of",
