<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Zirconium dioxide is a very interesting material as an dielectric for micro-electronics, and it has been studied extensively particularly for memory applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Other applications include electrolytes and interlayers for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and lately ZrO 2 films have also been studied for antibacterial purposes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Zirconium dioxide has a bandgap of 5.8 eV, and a suitable band offset of 1.4 eV to Si. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The relative permittivity of ZrO 2 in the bulk form is between 20 (monoclinic ZrO 2 ) and 47 (tetragonal ZrO 2 ). The monoclinic phase is stable at room temperature and the change from the monoclinic phase to the most desired high permittivity tetragonal phase occurs above 1100 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> However, in thin films, tetragonal, cubic, and orthorhombic ZrO 2 have been identified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> The effect of the surface energy is enhanced in thin films, making the appearance of high pressure and temperature phases possible.</p><p>Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the method of choice to produce highly conformal and uniform thin films, especially for the microelectronic applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> The first ZrO 2 process for ALD was ZrCl 4 /H 2 O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> Since then, various Zr precursors have been studied extensively, including amidinates, β-diketonates, and alkylamides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Unfortunately, all these have drawbacks regarding either growth rate or thermal stability.</p><p>Heteroleptic precursors, i.e., precursors with more than one type of ligands in the metal complex, have been widely studied for Zr. Possible benefits include better thermal stability, volatility, and reactivity compared to the homoleptic counterparts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> However, it is not always easy to predict the properties of the heteroleptic compounds and sometimes the result can be a combination of the undesirable properties of the ligands. Thus, it is important to study different heteroleptic compounds to understand the benefits they can offer compared to the traditional ALD precursors.</p><p>Advanced heteroleptic zirconium precursors applied in ALD most often have cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ring as one of the ligands. Cyclopentadienyls are good electron donors and form stable bonds with metals, which ensure good thermal stability of the compounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Also, the properties of the Cp ligands can easily be tuned by varying the number and composition of the substitutes on the ring. Examples of heteroleptic precursors with Cp ligands are RCpZr(NMe 2 ) 3 (R = H, ethyl or methyl), <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> RCp 2 ZrMe 2 (R = H or methyl), <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and MeCpZrCHT (CHT = cycloheptatrienyl). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Many of the heteroleptic precursors have been reported to exhibit selflimiting growth at 300 °C, including the CpZr(NMe 2 ) 3 that is widely used in industry. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> RCp 2 ZrMe 2 has a higher thermal stability of 350 °C but the as-deposited films consist of the low permittivity monoclinic ZrO 2 .</p><p>In this work, three heteroleptic zirconium precursors were studied as Zr sources in the atomic layer deposition of ZrO 2 . These compounds were cyclopentadienyl N,N-bis(tertbutyl) ethene-1,2-diaminato isopropylalkoxo zirconium Zr(Cp) ( t BuDAD)(O i Pr), methylcyclopentadienyl tris [2-(methylamino)  ethyl]aminate zirconium Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl triethoanolaminate zirconium Zr(Me 5 Cp) (TEA) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). All three precursors have a Cp ring as one of the ligands but the number of substituents in the ring varies. t BuDAD, TMEA, and TEA ligands were used to attain better thermal stability compared to the state-of-the-art heteroleptic precursors and at the same time to retain reasonable volatility for the precursors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EXPERIMENT A. Precursor characterization</head><p>Thermogravimetric analyses (TGAs) and precursor vapor pressure studies were carried out in a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 1 STARe System. Measurements were done under nitrogen atmosphere with a nitrogen flow of 220 sccm/min at atmospheric pressure. Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) was also studied under vacuum with a pressure of 20 Torr. A heating program of 10 °C/min was used in all the measurements. Vapor pressures were estimated by using evaporation rate at each temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Film deposition</head><p>Films were deposited in a hot-wall cross-flow F-120 ALD reactor (ASM Microchemistry) from Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr), Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), and Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) precursor (all from Air Liquide) with either water or ozone as the oxygen source. The Zr precursors were solid at room temperature, but Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr) and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) melted in the reactor at their source temperature. The evaporation temperatures for the precursors were 65 °C for Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr), 115 °C for Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA), and 120 °C for Zr(MeCp)(TMEA). The deposition temperatures were varied in the range of 200-425 °C. The reactor pressure was ∼5 mbar. Water was kept in a container at room temperature outside the reactor and the vapor flow was controlled by a needle valve. Ozone with a concentration of 100 g/m 3 was generated from O 2 (AGA 99.999%) in an ozone generator (Wedeco Modular 4 HC). Nitrogen (AGA 99.999% H 2 O ≤ 3 ppm, O 2 ≤ 3 ppm) was used as the carrier and purging gas. Si(100) wafers cut to 5 × 5 cm 2 pieces were used as substrates. Native oxide was not removed prior to deposition. For electrical measurements, films were deposited on Pt substrates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Film characterization</head><p>Film thicknesses were measured with x-ray reflectivity using a Rigaku SmartLab x-ray diffractometer. Film densities were obtained by fitting the XRR data. Crystallinity and phase of the films were determined by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with a PANalytical X´Pert Pro MPD diffractometer.</p><p>TEM specimens were prepared with the focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out method, with an FEI Quanta 3D 200i DualBeam instrument. Bright-field TEM images were collected with a 200 kV Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope.</p><p>Film compositions were examined with time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA) at a detection angle of 40°by 40 MeV 79 Br 7+ ions obtained from a 5 MV tandem accelerator EGP-10-II.</p><p>For the electrical measurements, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) plate capacitors with Pt/ZrO 2 /Al structures were made. ZrO 2 films were deposited on Pt evaporated on Si wafer. Aluminum dots with an area of 0.204 mm 2 were e-beam evaporated through a shadow mask on the top of the ZrO 2 films. The dot diameter used for calculating the area was obtained from SEM images. The Pt electrode thickness was 40 nm, and the Al dot thicknesses were approximately 90 nm. There were vacuum breaks between all depositions. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter with a step size of 0.2 V/step. The capacitance values were measured with a HP4284A LCR meter with a frequency of 10 kHz. Relative permittivities were calculated from the mean capacitances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Precursor properties</head><p>The TG curves of the three precursors are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>. Zr(Cp)(tBuDAD)(OiPr) and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) showed a single step weight loss in atmospheric pressure. The residue for the Zr(Cp)(tBuDAD)(OiPr) precursor was very low, below 2%, indicating evaporation without decomposition. For the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) precursor, the residue was around 15% which means that the precursor is also decomposing.</p><p>Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) showed a two-step weight loss process with a residue of 65% after the first step and 30% at the end of the measurement (500 °C) at atmospheric pressure. Because of the high residues, also a measurement under vacuum was conducted. The results in vacuum were clearly better than in atmospheric pressure as the residue after the first step at 230 °C was 15%. Despite the decomposition seen in the TG analysis, in the ALD experiments, the first signs of precursor decomposition were seen only at 400 °C. Differences in the decomposition temperature between TG analysis and ALD deposition 020912-2 Seppälä et al.: Comparative study on the use of novel heteroleptic Cp-based Zr precursors 020912-2 J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A, Vol. 37, No. 2, Mar/Apr 2019</p><p>experiments have previously been reported, for example, in ALD of CoO from CoCl 2 (TMEDA) (TMEDA = N,N,N 0 , N 0 -tetramethylethylenediamine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> and the probable cause for this comes from the differences in interactions in the gas phase and on the surface during the ALD process as compared to the interactions in the condensed phase in TG.</p><p>Vapor pressure studies of the precursors were in line with the TG results and showed that Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr) is substantially more volatile than the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) and Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) precursors [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b)</ref>]. Based on the vapor pressure, the evaporation temperatures for the ALD experiments were chosen to be 65 °C for Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD) (O i Pr) and 120 °C for Zr(MeCp)(TMEA). Sublimation temperature of 115 °C was chosen for the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) precursor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Film deposition</head><p>The reactivities of the Zr precursors especially toward water varied largely [Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>]. Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) did not react with water below 400 °C and at 400 °C, the growth rate was very low, 0.1 Å/cycle.</p><p>With the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/H 2 O process, films were deposited at 200-375 °C. Almost constant growth rate around 0.3 Å/cycle was obtained at 250-350 °C. Slight increase in the growth rate was observed at 375 °C. With the Zr(Cp) ( t BuDAD)(O i Pr)/H 2 O process, films were deposited at 250-425 °C. A temperature range with a constant growth rate of around 0.65 Å/cycle was seen from 325 to 400 °C [Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>].</p><p>All three precursors had higher growth rates with ozone than with water [Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref>]. Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 had a constant growth rate of 0.4 Å/cycle at 350-400 °C. The growth rate slightly increased at 425 °C because of the precursor decomposition. This decomposition was clearly observed from the appearance of some film deposits in the hot end of the source tube and it was not visible at lower deposition temperatures. The rather slow growth rates with Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) are probably caused by the bulky ligands that shield the Zr atoms and prevent reactions. TEA is also a chelating ligand with three oxygen donor atoms that are expected to bond stronger to Zr than the nitrogen donors in TMEA and t BuDAD [Zr-O bond strength is ∼760 kJ/mol and FIG. 3. (a) Film growth rates at different temperatures with (a) water and (b) ozone as the oxygen source. Pulse times for Zr precursors, H 2 O and O 3 were 1.0 s and purge times for all pulses 1.5 s. 020912-3 Seppälä et al.: Comparative study on the use of novel heteroleptic Cp-based Zr precursors 020912-3 The deposition temperature affected the film density as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. The bulk density of ZrO 2 is around 6 g/cm 3 depending on the phase. With Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) and Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr), a considerable increase in the density was seen with increasing deposition temperature regardless of the oxygen source. With water, the film densities ranged from 5.7 to 5.9 g/cm 3 at the highest deposition temperatures, whereas at 250 °C the density decreased to 4.4 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> for Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) (3.8 g/cm 3 at 200 °C) and 4.7 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> for Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr) [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(a)</ref>]. With ozone, slightly higher densities compared to water processes were observed at 250 °C. Because of the changes in the film density, the amount of material deposited, for example, in the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) processes is much higher at 350 °C (1.47 and 0.79 Zr atoms/ nm 2 cycle with O 3 and H 2 O) and 375 °C (1.47 and 0.93 Zr atoms/nm 2 ⋅cycle with O 3 and H 2 O) compared to 250 °C (1.30 and 0.55 Zr atoms/nm 2 cycle with O 3 and H 2 O) even though the growth rates are close to each other. Likewise, taking the density increase into account, the increase of the growth rate with increasing temperature in the Zr(Cp) ( t BuDAD)(O i Pr)/O 3 process gets even stronger: 1.0 Zr atoms/nm 2 cycle at 250 °C, 1.8 Zr atoms/nm 2 ⋅cycle at 300 °C, and 3.9 atoms/nm 2 ⋅cycle at 375 °C.</p><p>Films deposited with Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) and ozone showed only a small decrease in density from 5.9 to 5.4 g/cm 3 while decreasing the deposition temperature [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(b)</ref>]. The thickness of the films did not affect the density: films with thicknesses around 10 nm showed densities similar to 40 nm thick films at 300-375 °C. With water, density was very low (4.7 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> ) compared to the ozone process despite the high deposition temperatures of 400 and 425 °C [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(a)</ref>]. The film thicknesses were similar in both processes. The low density appears to be due to the low reactivity of the Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA) precursor with water which is seen in the low growth rate [Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>] and high impurity concentrations (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>) in the films. Because of the low densities and very low growth rates, only a few films with the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/ H 2 O process were deposited.</p><p>The effect of the Zr precursor pulse length on the growth rate was studied to reveal the true, self-limiting ALD-type growth processes. Self-limiting growth mode was confirmed for the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 process at 300, 350 (not shown), and 375 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). The growth rate was 0.3 Å/cycle at 300 °C and 0.4 Å/cycle at 350 and 375 °C. At 400 °C, the growth rate increased slightly with increasing pulse length from 0.38 Å/ cycle at 1.0 s pulse length to 0.46 Å/cycle at 3.5 s Zr precursor pulse. This result demonstrates that the thermal stability of the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) precursor is one of the highest among zirconium precursors and clearly higher than the thermal stability of the industrially dominant CpZr(NMe 2 ) 3 precursor which saturates at 300 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Despite the very strong temperature dependence, self-limiting growth was also observed in the Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr)/O 3 process at 250 °C (0.5 Å/cycle) but not at higher deposition temperatures. However, at this low deposition temperature, the film density was somewhat lower than the bulk value of ZrO 2 . Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) did not show saturation of the growth with ozone and none of the Zr precursors saturated when water was used as the oxygen source. The saturation studies for the ozone processes are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Film characterization</head><p>All the three studied precursors showed similar trends regarding film crystallinity: The films were crystalline ZrO 2 , and the phase was either tetragonal ZrO 2 (ICDD 50-1089) or a mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic (ICDD 37-1484) ZrO 2 depending on the growth temperature and oxygen source. At low deposition temperatures, only tetragonal phase was seen. With water, the temperature at which the monoclinic phase appeared was higher than with ozone. The first small peaks from the monoclinic phase were visible at 300 °C with all Zr precursors when ozone was used as the oxygen source. With water, monoclinic peaks were first seen at 400 °C with the Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr) and at 350 °C with the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) precursor, whereas only tetragonal phase was seen with the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) precursor (at 400 and 425 °C). The intensity of the monoclinic peaks increased with increasing temperature. The effect of the deposition temperature on the crystalline phase of the films is exemplified in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> by Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/H 2 O processes.</p><p>In addition to the deposition temperature, the film thickness affected the phase composition. It has been reported before that in ALD of ZrO 2 very thin films favor the tetragonal phase and with increasing film thickness the intensity of the monoclinic peaks increases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26</ref> The stabilization of the tetragonal phase in thin films has been attributed to the lower FIG. 6.

For example, films with thicknesses between 9 and 70 nm deposited with Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr)/H 2 O at 375 °C were all tetragonal ZrO 2 [Fig. <ref type="figure">7(a)</ref>]. With the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)/H 2 O process at 350 °C, the first small monoclinic peaks were seen with a film thickness of 50 nm. With ozone, only very thin films were tetragonal: with the Zr(MeCp)(TMEA) at 350 °C, only the tetragonal phase was detected for a 4 nm thick film, but monoclinic peaks were visible in a 9 nm thick film. For Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 process at 300 °C, 12 nm thick film was tetragonal ZrO 2 but monoclinic peaks could be seen in a 29 nm thick film [Fig. <ref type="figure">7(b)</ref>]. At 375 °C, a small peak assigned to the monoclinic phase was visible already in the diffractogram of a 10 nm thick film meaning that the deposition temperature seems to have a stronger impact on the phase composition than the film thickness. Impurities and film compositions were studied with TOF-ERDA. The results are collected in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. In general, the films deposited with ozone had lower impurity contents than the films deposited with water. This kind of trend has been seen previously in oxide ALD depositions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The high purity is attributed to the more efficient removal of the ligands by combustion with ozone than by hydrolysis reactions with water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28</ref> Exceptionally pure films were obtained with the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 process at 300-375 °C where the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content were below or slightly over the detection limit of TOF-ERDA. In this precursor, Zr is already attached to three oxygen atoms which may explain the high purity. The films deposited with Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), which did not show saturation of the growth rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>), had higher impurity levels than the others, especially at low deposition temperatures where the hydrogen levels with both water and ozone were considerable.</p><p>Capacitor structures were constructed to compare the electrical properties of the different ZrO 2 processes.  020912-6 Seppälä et al.: Comparative study on the use of novel heteroleptic Cp-based Zr precursors 020912-6</p><p>for the capacitors were deposited at 300 °C with all processes.

The permittivity values for the ZrO 2 films deposited at 300 °C with different deposition processes ranged from 23 to 29. The highest permittivity was calculated for the film deposited with the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 . TEM image showed that the lateral grain size in this film is 20-30 nm [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8(b)</ref>]. The permittivities for the other processes remained clearly lower, being 23 or 24 (Table <ref type="table">II</ref>). The permittivities of the films deposited at 350 and 375 °C with the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 process were lower than at 300 °C, probably because of the increasing amount of monoclinic phase in the films. The dielectric loss values were 0.01 or lower in all the samples.

The higher leakage current could be caused by hydrogen impurities or lower quality of the film/ bottom electrode interface compared to the other processes. In the case of Zr(Cp)( t BuDAD)(O i Pr), clearly higher leakage current densities were obtained with water than with ozone as the oxygen source. The higher impurity content (especially carbon) and lower density of the films deposited with water compared to ozone are a likely cause for the higher leakage current density. With Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), the values were in the same range with both oxygen sources. With the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA)/O 3 process, leakage current densities were in the order of 10 -8 A/cm 2 at 1 MV/cm. Very low leakage current of 2 ⋅ 10 -8 A/cm 2 was also measured for the Zr(Cp) ( t BuDAD)(O i Pr)/O 3 process, whereas with Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), the leakage current densities were in the order of 10 -7 and 10 -6 A/cm 2 for both water and ozone deposited films. Leakage current densities for the different capacitors measured at 1 MV/cm are shown in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Three heteroleptic Zr precursors, Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA), Zr(Cp) ( t BuDAD)(O i Pr), and Zr(MeCp)(TMEA), were studied for the ALD of ZrO 2 using water or ozone as the oxygen source. The growth rates, crystal phases, impurity contents, and electrical properties were evaluated. Excellent film purity was achieved with all the Zr precursors with ozone and especially with the Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) precursor where pure ZrO 2 films were deposited with impurity levels below or at the detection limit (0.1 at. %) of TOF-ERDA. With water, higher impurity levels were detected compared to ozone, but water favored the formation of the high-κ tetragonal ZrO 2 phase. With ozone, most films were mixtures of tetragonal and monoclinic phases with the monoclinic peak intensity increasing with increasing deposition temperature. The best precursor was found to be Zr(Me 5 Cp)(TEA) with excellent thermal stability; self-limiting growth was achieved at as high as 375 °C with a growth rate of 0.4 Å/cycle. These films also had low leakage current densities in the order of 10 -8 A/cm 2 at 1 MV/cm. Key features of the processes are collected in Table <ref type="table">III</ref> and compared with selected processes from the literature.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 . 2 J</head><label>12</label><figDesc>FIG. 1.
