The X-ray diffraction patterns show the crystalline structure of Zr(Cp)(tBuDAD)(O^iPr)/H2O and Zr(Me5Cp)(TEA)/O3 samples at different particle sizes. The peaks correspond to specific crystallographic planes (t for tetragonal, m for monoclinic). The intensity of the peaks varies with sample size, indicating changes in crystallinity.
