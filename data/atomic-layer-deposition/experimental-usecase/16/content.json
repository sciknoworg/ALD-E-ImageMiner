Excellent film purity with C, H, and  $Nu$  levels below the detection limit of the elastic recoil detection analysis was obtained with ozone as the oxygen source. All the studied processes showed the same trend that at low deposition temperatures films were tetragonal  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and at higher temperatures mixtures of tetragonal and monoclinic  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  . With water, the monoclinic phase appeared at higher temperatures than with ozone. In addition to the deposition temperature, the film thickness affected the phase; thinner films favored the tetragonal phase and monoclinic peaks were more clearly seen in thicker films. The high thermal stability and excellent film purity show that from the three studied  $\\mathrm{Zr}$  precursors,  $\\mathrm{Zr(Me_5Cp)(TEA)}$  is a noteworthy precursor candidate for ALD of  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  .Published by the AVS. https://doi.org/10.1116/1.5079539",

The higher leakage current could be caused by hydrogen impurities or lower quality of the film/ bottom electrode interface compared to the other processes. In the case of  $\\mathrm{Zr(Cp)(^tBuDAD)(O^iPr)}$ , clearly higher leakage current densities were obtained with water than with ozone as the oxygen source. The higher impurity content (especially carbon) and lower density of the films deposited with water compared to ozone are a likely cause for the higher leakage current density. With  $\\mathrm{Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)}$ , the values were in the same range with both oxygen sources. With the  $\\mathrm{Zr(Me_5Cp)(TEA) / O_3}$  process, leakage current densities were in the order of  $10^{- 6}\\mathrm{A / cm^2}$  at  $1\\mathrm{MV / cm}$ . Very low leakage current of  $2\\cdot 10^{- 8}\\mathrm{A / cm^2}$  was also measured for the  $\\mathrm{Zr(Cp)(^tBuDAD)(O^iPr) / O_3}$  process, whereas with  $\\mathrm{Zr(MeCp)(TMEA)}$ , the leakage current densities were in the order of  $10^{- 7}$  and  $10^{- 6}\\mathrm{A / cm^2}$  for both water and ozone deposited films.

The growth rates, crystal phases, impurity contents, and electrical properties were evaluated. Excellent film purity was achieved with all the  $\\mathrm{Zr}$  precursors with ozone and especially with the  $\\mathrm{Zr(Me_5Cp)(TEA)}$  precursor where pure  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  films were deposited with impurity levels below or at the detection limit (0.1 at.  $\\%$  ) of TOF- ERDA. With water, higher impurity levels were detected compared to ozone, but water favored the formation of the high-  $\\kappa$  tetragonal  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  phase. With ozone, most films were mixtures of tetragonal and monoclinic phases with the monoclinic peak intensity increasing with increasing deposition temperature. The best precursor was found to be  $\\mathrm{Zr(Me_5Cp)(TEA)}$  with excellent thermal stability; self- limiting growth was achieved at as high as  $375^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  with a growth rate of  $0.4\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$ . These films also had low leakage current densities in the order of  $10^{- 8}\\mathrm{A / cm^2}$  at  $1\\mathrm{MV / cm}$ . Key features of the processes are collected in Table III and compared with selected processes from the literature.",
