The chart illustrates the change in the average oxidation state of manganese (Mn) in different forms of manganese oxides (MnO2, LiMn2O4, MnO) as the amount of lithium cycles increases. The oxidation state decreases with increasing lithium cycles, indicating a reduction in the oxidation state of manganese.
