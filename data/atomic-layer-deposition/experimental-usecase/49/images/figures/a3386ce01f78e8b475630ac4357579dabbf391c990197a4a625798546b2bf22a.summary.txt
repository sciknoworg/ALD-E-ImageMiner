The image illustrates the fabrication process of ALD-MoS2/TiNTs using Ti foil through anodization and ALD-MoS2 deposition. It includes SEM images showing the TiNTs structure at different magnifications, a Raman spectrum comparing TiNTs and MoS2/TiNTs, TEM images highlighting the interface between TiO2 and MoS2, and EDS elemental mapping for Mo, S-K & Mo-L, Ti, and O.
