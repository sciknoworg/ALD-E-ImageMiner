Due to these benefits, ALD is becoming one of the most promising thin- film deposition methods in the fabrication of nanoscale microelectronic devices, for which thickness controllability at atomic level and high conformality are required. One of the critical issues for a successful ALD process is a proper selection of precursors and reactants. Among many metal precursors, alkylamide precursors have been widely used for ALD since they have suitable vapor pressure and  $\\mathrm{Cl^- }$  and O- free ligands producing noncorrosive products and require relatively low growth temperatures.",

As representative high  $k$  oxides,  $\\mathrm{Ta_2O_5}$  and  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  have been studied for various applications including capacitor and gate dielectrics for the semiconductor industry and chemical sensors. Although various precursors have been studied for ALD of Ta and Ti- based materials, alkylamide precursors have been widely used for deposition of  $\\mathrm{TaN^{13}}$  or TiN. For example, plasma- enhanced ALD (PE- ALD) of TaN from (pentakis(dimethylamino)Ta (PDMAT) and hydrogen plasma produced good quality TaN, showing very robust characteristics as a diffusion barrier for Cu interconnects. However, the alkylamide precursors have rarely been used for deposition of Ta or Ti oxide, except in a couple of very recent reports. This is quite contrary to other high-  $k$  materials such as  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  for which extensive studies have been reported by thermal and PE- ALD from various alkylamide precursors. Especially, no comparative study between thermal and PE- ALD from alkylamide precursors for Ta and Ti oxides has been reported yet.

The sample was heated using a resistive heating plate, providing growth temperatures of up to  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The temperature was measured using a thermocouple attached to the heater, and calibrated against another thermocouple attached to the sample.

For TDMAT, which has high enough vapor pressure, the bubbler remains at room temperature without the use of a carrier gas. For thermal ALD, the water vapor was used as a reactant. The bubbler containing water was immersed in silicone oil for better temperature control, and the water vapor flow was controlled by a leak valve.

For both cases, three distinguished regions can be identified in the figure. In the middle temperature region, the growth rates remain almost constant, indicating the existence of a process window. For thermal ALD this region is from 200 to  $250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  while for PE- ALD it is from 150 to  $250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . In other words, the ALD can be achieved at almost  $50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  lower temperature by PE- ALD than by thermal ALD. This lower growth temperature is usually attributed to the higher reactivity of radicals, in this case atomic O or activated  $\\mathrm{O_2}$ . In fact, in a separate experiment,  $\\mathrm{Ta_2O_5}$  film was not deposited without the use of plasma at  $T_{\\mathrm{s}} = 250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , indicating that the activated species generated by plasma are necessary to deposit  $\\mathrm{Ta_2O_5}$ . In the high temperature region, the growth rates increase with increasing growth temperature. This behavior is due to the disturbance of self- limitation caused by thermal decomposition of precursors leading to partially CVD- like growth. In the low growth temperature region, the growth rates increase with decreasing growth temperature for both thermal and PE- ALD. One of the plausible explanations proposed for this phenomenon is that the concentration of surface OH groups becomes higher with decreasing growth temperature, which leads to a larger number of active sites resulting in a higher growth rate in the low growth temperature region. This explanation could be generally applied for thermal ALD of oxide using water as a reactant. However, for PE- ALD using oxygen plasma as a reactant, the formation of an OH- terminated surface has not been clearly identified yet. In a more recent report, OES analysis of oxygen plasma indicated the presence of hydrogen radicals, which could result in OH- terminated surface by reaction of oxygen radicals with hydrogen likely to originate from precursors. Thus, the same explanation would be applicable for PE- ALD of oxides, but more detailed experiments on the reaction mechanism of PE- ALD from oxygen plasma would be required to determine the exact reason for this behavior.",

A possible explanation for this behavior is that the TDMAT molecules do not adsorb on the surface with perfect self- saturation, probably due to the low decomposition temperature of the TDMAT precursor, which is reported to be about  $180^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Similar behavior was reported for TiN ALD from TDMAT and  $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ .

Pure  $\\mathrm{Ta}_2\\mathrm{O}_5$  films were successfully deposited by thermal and PE- ALD from PDMAT with a good self- saturation property.
