        "text": "The ovonic threshold switch (OTS) based on the voltage snapback of amorphous chalcogenides possesses several desirable characteristics: bidirectional switching, a controllable threshold voltage  $(V_{\\mathrm{th}})$  and processability for three- dimensional stackable devices. Among the materials that can be used as OTS, GeSe has a strong glass- forming ability  $(\\sim 350^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  crystallization temperature), with a simple binary composition. Described herein is a new method of depositing GeSe films through atomic layer deposition (ALD), using  $\\mathrm{HGeCl}_3$  and  $[(\\mathsf{CH}_3)_3\\mathsf{Si}]_2\\mathsf{Se}$  as Ge and Se precursors, respectively. The stoichiometric GeSe thin films were formed through a ligand exchange reaction between the two precursor molecules, without the adoption of an additional reaction gas, at low substrate temperatures ranging from  $70^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The pseudo- saturation behavior required a long time of Ge precursor injection to achieve the saturation growth rate. This was due to the adverse influence of the physisorbed precursor and byproduct molecules on the efficient chemical adsorption reaction between the precursors and reaction sites. To overcome the slow saturation and excessive use of the Ge precursor, the discrete feeding method (DFM), where  $\\mathrm{HGeCl}_3$  is supplied multiple times consecutively with subdivided pulse times, was adopted. DFM led to the saturation of the GeSe growth rate at a much shorter total injection time of the Ge precursor, and improved the film density and oxidation resistance properties. The GeSe film grown via DFM exhibited a short OTS time of  $\\sim 40$  ns, a  $\\sim 10^{7}\\mathrm{ON / OFF}$  current ratio, and  $\\sim 10^{4}$  selectivity. The OTS behavior was consistent with the modified Poole- Frenkel mechanism in the OFF state. In contrast, the similar GeSe film grown through the conventional ALD showed a low density and high vulnerability to oxidation, which prevented the OTS performance. The ALD method of GeSe films introduced here will contribute to the fabrication of a three- dimensionally integrated memory as a selector device for preventing sneak current.",

The three- dimensional- (3D)- stackable memory of the crossbar array has been proposed as a promising solution to overcome the existing limitations in the memory density of the PcRAM in a 2D planar integration structure. Despite the advances in 3D structural designs to scale down the memory, sneak current, which frustrates the accurate reading/writing of data in each cell, has remained a critical issue. Selector devices like the P- N junction diodes, metal- insulator- metal diodes, and ovonic threshold switch (OTS) have been devised to minimize these errors in operation [6]. Among the options for the selector device, the OTS using amorphous chalcogenides has the preferable property of a bidirectional, controllable threshold voltage  $(V_{\\mathrm{th}})$  and process compatibility with chalcogenide- based phase change materials. The material properties required in OTS, however, are different from those needed in PcRAM. For the memory element, both the appropriate crystallization speed and amorphous stability are among the essential requirements since the memory operation is based on the reversible change between the crystal and amorphous phases. The pseudo- binary system of  $\\mathrm{GeTe - Sb_2Te_3}$  has shown to possess the desirable properties. In the case of OTS, only the latter requirement on the amorphous stability is critical since the threshold switching is the characteristics of the amorphous phase, and no crystallization is involved for the material function as a selector.",

The GeSe- based OTS device is often used as a selector component in a 1- selector- 1- resistor 1s1R) structure for the stable operation of the crossbar arrays of random access memory. Previous studies successfully demonstrated a the 1s1R structure consisting of the stacking layers of the GeSe and resistive memory layer as a selector and memory element, respectively [9, 10]. Researchers also investigated the dependence of thermal stability and  $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$  on the Ge concentration in  $\\mathrm{Ge}_x\\mathrm{Se}_{(1 - x)}$  compounds [11]. Additionally, Sband N- doped Se- rich GeSe films have been proven to improve the performance of OTS [12]. Although the previous studies provided valuable information on the relation between the compositions and the OTS behavior, the adopted physical vapor deposition methods have limited applicability in the fabrication of 3D- stackable- matrix- integrated devices, due to their limited step coverage.",

Despite the achievement in the conformal and uniform morphologies of the  $\\mathrm{GeTe}_2$  and GeTe films in previous studies, these unconventional precursors may cause complicated ALD growth behaviors due to the steric hindrance from the physisorbed molecules (i.e., precursors, byproducts). Various modified ALD methods have been suggested to be used to address this undesirable phenomenon. The discrete feeding method (DFM) has been shown to efficiently remove the physisorbed molecules in a  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  deposition by subdividing the precursor pulse and purge times [19]. It has also contributed to the improved film properties, such as a higher film density and a low impurity concentration, owing to the more fluent ALD reaction steps.",

To confirm the ALD- type saturation behavior, the process time of each step was varied while the other process time was kept constant. The recipe for ALD- DFM is Ge precursor pulse (1 s)—purge (5 s)—pulse (1 s)—purge (5 s)—pulse (1 s)—purge (5 s)—Se precursor (2 s)—purge (15 s). In this case, the 7 s long Ge precursor pulse time was shortened to 3 s but was divided into three 1 s's, and the 15 s long purge time was divided into three 5 s's while the Se precursor pulse and purge times remained unchanged.

Here, a Ge precursor was injected through three 1 s consecutive pulses (total pulse time: 3 s) to compare its growth rate with the growth rate from the conventional ALD process. In DFM, the purge was also adjusted to three 5 s consecutive Ar pulses (total purge time: 15 s). Figure 3(a) shows that the growth rate reaches the saturation level with three 1 s Ge pulses  $(46.7\\mathrm{ngcm}^{- 2}\\mathrm{y}^{- 1})$ . The rate is significantly larger than that from the conventional ALD process with a 3 s Ge pulse, and is comparable to the saturated value of the conventional ALD (7 s) within an error range. Figure 3(b) compares the growth rates of the GeSe film depending on the relative amount of Ge precursor injection with a given Ge pulse time (3 s). Due to the high vapor pressure of  $\\mathrm{HGeCl}_3$  the amount of the Ge precursor injection was adjusted by limiting the opening of a metering valve manually. The injection amount was reduced through the partial closure of the valve by changing the valve rotation number from the initial 3 to 2 and 1. It should be noted that the input amount control is only relative and not absolute because the information on the absolute amount depending on the valve rotation was not available. In all the cases, the DFM resulted in higher growth rates than with the conventional method, and showed a saturated growth rate with a reduced precursor amount (blue circle data in figure 3(b)). Therefore, the DFM with the present conditions (three- time rotation of the manual valve and 1 s injection x 3) represents the fully saturated ALD growth despite its much shorter total Ge precursor pulse time. An even more important finding is that this faster saturation in DFM drastically enhanced the film quality and the OTS performance of the device compared with the similar film prepared through the conventional ALD process, as will be shown later. The conventional ALD method, however, showed a proportionally decreasing growth rate as the injection amount was reduced, consistent with the undersaturated condition of the 3 s Ge pulse time (red square data in figure 3(b)).",

The different bonding type can explain the different saturation behavior in the conventional ALD of Ge- Te and Ge- Se films. The deposited GeTe has a non- polar bonding nature due to the minimal difference in electronegativity between Ge and Te (0.09, in the Pauling electronegativity scale) while GeSe has a polar bonding nature due to the larger difference in electronegativity (0.54) [20]. The polarity of the Ge- Se bonds induces a stronger dipole- dipole interaction between the film surface and the pulsed  $\\mathrm{HGeCl}_3$  and other byproducts, possibly leading to the stronger (physical) adsorption of the molecules compared to the non- polar van der Waals forces [21].

Here, both the conventional ALD and ALD- DFM methods adopted saturated conditions for the precursor and purge injection times (conventional ALD: Ge precursor pulse (7 s)- purge (15 s)- Se precursor pulse (2 s)- purge (15 s); ALD- DFM: Ge precursor pulse (1 s)- purge (5 s)- pulse (1 s)- purge (5 s)- pulse (1 s)- purge (5 s)- Se precursor (2 s)- purge (15 s)). The graphs for the conventional ALD reveal that the film grows linearly with the cycle number, without significant incubation cycles. From the linear fitting, the 48.26 and  $43.84\\mathrm{ngcm}^{- 2}\\mathrm{cy}^{- 1}$  growth rates on the  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  and TiN substrates, respectively, were confirmed. The growth rate of the film thickness can be calculated by dividing the growth rate in  $\\mathrm{ngcm}^{- 2}\\mathrm{cy}^{- 1}$  by the film density obtained from XRR measurement, and the converted rate of  $1.12\\mathrm{\\AA}\\mathrm{cy}^{- 1}$  was obtained. The  $x$  value in  $\\mathrm{Ge}_x\\mathrm{Se}_{(1 - x)}$  was also shown to be  $\\sim 0.5$  regardless of the number of cycles. Overall, the results suggest a reasonable growth rate and a stoichiometry consistent with the reaction mechanism expected for normal ALD [22, 23]. The saturated growth rate from the DFM cannot be similarly estimated because only two data points are available (25 and 100 cycles). These data points (red diamond), however, precisely lie on the graphs from the conventional ALD process, suggesting a similar growth behavior.",

        "text": "The XPS analysis result presented in figure 7 supports the difference in the chemical stability of the films against oxidation depending on the deposition method used. For this comparison, the XPS measurements were done without surface etching. (When in situ etching was performed to remove the surface contaminants, the XPS peaks were unstable for the short etching times. After the extended etching times, the film recovered the original peaks due to the immediate reoxidation of the exposed surface.) Consistent with the AES result in figure 6, the Ge- oxide peaks in figures 7(a) and (b) show that almost the entire thickness of the films was contaminated by oxygen, possibly during the air exposure. The 1:1 stoichiometry of GeSe observed in the AES depth profiles also supports this idea because the higher binding energy between Ge and O than that between Ge and Se would have led to a higher Ge/Se ratio, which is inconsistent with the AES results. Figure 7(a) shows that the Ge- oxide peak was substantially larger than the Ge- Se peak for the conventional ALD process. In the case of the ALD- DFM process, the Ge- Se peak was significant (figure 7(b)). The locations of the Ge 3d and Se 3d peaks well match the binding energy in GeSe (Ge 3d B.E.:  $\\sim 30.7\\mathrm{eV}$ ; Se 3d B.E.:  $\\sim 54.3\\mathrm{eV}$ ) [25, 26]. As the Se 3d peak was observed at the previously reported binding energy without a significant shift (figures 7(c) and (d)), it can be concluded that Se was always bonded to two Ge atoms, consistent with the stoichiometric composition of GeSe. The results indicate that oxidation progressed less for the film grown through the ALD- DFM process than for the films grown through the conventional ALD process. It is possible that the lower density of the conventional ALD film allowed the easier penetration of the film by oxygen during the air exposure due to the highly porous surface. In either case, the observations suggest that the screening effect of the physisorbed molecules deteriorates the film quality, and that DFM can improve the quality by increasing the frequency of purging.",

(The subscripts and superscript of C represent the coordination number and the charge of the chalcogen atom (C), respectively.) These charged defects form localized states acting as deep and shallow traps near the Fermi level and the conduction band, respectively. When a voltage is applied, the traps provide a current path with a lowered energy barrier. It is hard for devices fabricated through the conventional ALD process, however, to possess such traps due to the stronger binding energy of Ge- O. For disproportionation to occur, the Coulombic repulsion energy  $(U_{c})$  should be compensated for by polaron shift  $(w)$ . In particular, the negative- U model can be established when  $w > U_{c} / 2$  is satisfied [31]. The polaron shift is defined as  $Q^2 /2k$  in the mechanical analogy of the negative- U effect (Q: deformation potential for the localized carriers;  $k$  spring constant), where  $k$  can be considered the binding energy value [31]. The model can explain the difference between  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  and SiTe in VAPs formation. In  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  (B.E.  $\\sim 799.6\\mathrm{kJ}\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1}$ ), polaron shift cannot proceed due to the difficulty in lattice deformation; as such, the formation of VAPs is suppressed.

The 1:1 stoichiometric composition of GeSe was achieved by the decomposition of  $\\mathrm{HGeCl}_3$  into divalent  $\\mathrm{GeCl}_2$  and the subsequent ligand exchange reaction with the  $[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{Si}]_2\\mathrm{Se}$ . This is a mechanism similar to the previously reported GeTe ALD using an identical Ge precursor and  $[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3\\mathrm{Si}]_2\\mathrm{Te}$ . Nonetheless, the much higher polar nature of the Ge- Se bond compared with the Ge- Te bond induced an inefficient purging of the physisorbed Ge precursor molecules, which",

This process showed problems in guaranteeing a high- quality film, and the resulting films were highly vulnerable to the oxidation during the air exposure after the ALD. The adverse oxidation totally prohibited the desired OTS switching behavior of the fabricated device. In contrast, the film grown through the ALD- DFM process, which effectively purged out the excessive Ge precursor molecules during the ALD, resulted in a much denser and smooth film. DFM induced a growth rate at a total Ge precursor pulse time of  $3\\mathrm{s}$  that was identical to that at a total Ge precursor pulse time of  $7\\mathrm{s}$  in the conventional ALD process. This higher density film effectively suppressed the adverse oxidation of the film, which allowed the fluent operation of the device in the OTS mode. The achieved switching time was as short as  $40\\mathrm{ns}$  and the selectivity was as high as  $10^{4}$ , among the highest reported for the chalcogenide- based OTS selectors. The fitting of the current- voltage curve to the modified PF equation revealed that the trap density was  $5.36 \\times 10^{20}\\mathrm{cm}^{- 3}$ .",
