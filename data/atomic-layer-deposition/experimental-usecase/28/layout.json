The three- dimensional- (3D)- stackable memory of the crossbar array has been proposed as a promising solution to overcome the existing limitations in the memory density of the PcRAM in a 2D planar integration structure. Despite the advances in 3D structural designs to scale down the memory, sneak current, which frustrates the accurate reading/writing of data in each cell, has remained a critical issue. Selector devices like the P- N junction diodes, metal- insulator- metal diodes, and ovonic threshold switch (OTS) have been devised to minimize these errors in operation [6]. Among the options for the selector device, the OTS using amorphous chalcogenides has the preferable property of a bidirectional, controllable threshold voltage "

The process recipes of the ALD sequence were designed to prevent a gas phase reaction between the precursors. The precursor sequence of the conventional ALD was determined as follows, through the ALD saturation experiments: Ge precursor pulse (7 s)—purge (15 s)—Se precursor pulse (2 s)—purge (15 s). To confirm the ALD- type saturation behavior, the process time of each step was varied while the other process time was kept constant. The recipe for ALD- DFM is Ge precursor pulse (1 s)—purge (5 s)—pulse (1 s)—purge (5 s)—pulse (1 s)—purge (5 s)—Se precursor (2 s)—purge (15 s). In this case, the 7 s long Ge precursor pulse time was shortened to 3 s but was divided into three 1 s's, and the 15 s long purge time was divided into three 5 s's while the Se precursor pulse and purge times remained unchanged. For comparison, the conventional ALD process with 3 s long Ge precursor pulses was also tested. The reaction mechanism between "

The injection amount was reduced through the partial closure of the valve by changing the valve rotation number from the initial 3 to 2 and 1. It should be noted that the input amount control is only relative and not absolute because the information on the absolute amount depending on the valve rotation was not available. In all the cases, the DFM resulted in higher growth rates than with the conventional method, and showed a saturated growth rate with a reduced precursor amount (blue circle data in figure 3(b)). Therefore, the DFM with the present conditions (three- time rotation of the manual valve and 1 s injection x 3) represents the fully saturated ALD growth despite its much shorter total Ge precursor pulse time. An even more important finding is that this faster saturation in DFM drastically enhanced the film quality and the OTS performance of the device compared with the similar film prepared through the conventional ALD process, as will be shown later. The conventional ALD method, however, showed a proportionally decreasing growth rate as the injection amount was reduced, consistent with the undersaturated condition of the 3 s Ge pulse time (red square data in figure 3(b))."

The different bonding type can explain the different saturation behavior in the conventional ALD of Ge- Te and Ge- Se films. The deposited GeTe has a non- polar bonding nature due to the minimal difference in electronegativity between Ge and Te (0.09, in the Pauling electronegativity scale) while GeSe has a polar bonding nature due to the larger difference in electronegativity (0.54) [20].

The 1:1 stoichiometry of GeSe observed in the AES depth profiles also supports this idea because the higher binding energy between Ge and O than that between Ge and Se would have led to a higher Ge/Se ratio, which is inconsistent with the AES results. Figure 7(a) shows that the Ge- oxide peak was substantially larger than the Ge- Se peak for the conventional ALD process.

As the Se 3d peak was observed at the previously reported binding energy without a significant shift (figures 7(c) and (d)), it can be concluded that Se was always bonded to two Ge atoms, consistent with the stoichiometric composition of GeSe. The results indicate that oxidation progressed less for the film grown through the ALD- DFM process than for the films grown through the conventional ALD process. It is possible that the lower density of the conventional ALD film allowed the easier penetration of the film by oxygen during the air exposure due to the highly porous surface. In either case, the observations suggest that the screening effect of the physisorbed molecules deteriorates the film quality, and that DFM can improve the quality by increasing the frequency of purging."
