The diagram illustrates a setup for a plasma process involving gases like H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub>, and NH<sub>3</sub>. It includes components such as a quartz tube with an rf coil, a heated substrate, and various valves and pumps. The timeline chart on the right shows the sequence of operations including PDMAT, Ar, gases, plasma power, and top valve.
