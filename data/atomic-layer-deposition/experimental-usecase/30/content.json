In another study, preferred growth of magnetite has been observed in a sputtering deposition process using relatively low sputtering power.

In the latter study, the major peak appeared at ca.  $30.5^{\\circ}$  and was attributed to the 220 reflection of  $\\gamma - \\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ . Most of the other peaks were attributed to iron hydroxide, which do not match with the peaks observed in the present study, neither does the formation of hydroxides seem likely in the water- free process provided at that high temperature. Similarly, the peaks at 30.5 and  $35.5^{\\circ}$  have been assigned as 220 and 311 of  $\\gamma - \\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  in a study on the iron oxide nanostructures obtained in a solvothermal process as well as by a wet chemical method. The presence of maghemite can thus be considered, although the main reflection, i.e. that at  $26.103^{\\circ}$ , which could be significant while distinguishing between magnetite and maghemite, was not apparent in most of the patterns recorded in the present study as well as in the reference given. Traces of that peak (PDF card 039- 1346) may be recognized in the iron oxide film as- deposited at  $375^{\\circ}C$  (Fig. 1, bottom panel), and even in annealed film grown at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (Fig. 1, middle panel). However, the appearance of the maghemite reflections was obviously not systematic in terms of growth or annealing parameters. Single phase maghemite could, in principle, be deposited on  $\\mathrm{MgO}$  substrate. In addition, if the stoichiometry of the films were close to that of magnesioferrite  $\\mathrm{MgFe_2O_4}$ , then some significant peaks would also overlap with those of magnetite. For instance, locations of strong 220, 311 and 400 reflections of both  $\\mathrm{MgFe_2O_4}$  (PDF card 017- 0464) and magnetite are identical. Distinction between maghemite, magnetite and magnesioferrite phases may be possible by XRD, but remains complicated.

Room- temperature Raman spectra of selected films are depicted in Figure 3. The bands are denoted in accord with Shebanova et al. In the spectra, one could at first consider bands at 225, 293, 412, 498, 613, and  $1320~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$  which are typical for  $\\alpha - \\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ , i.e. the hematite phase. Further, bands at 380, 500, 720, 1450 and  $1580~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$  are typical of  $\\gamma - \\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  (maghemite) and the bands at 668, 538, 306, and  $193~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$  are typical for  $\\mathrm{Fe}_3\\mathrm{O}_4$  (magnetite). It should also be mentioned, that the shoulder at  $700~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$  for the main band at  $668~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$  (Fig. 3, the  $3^{\\circ}$  panel) can also be attributed to magnesioferrite according to the Raman database. One could conclude that the non- doped films (not shown) as well as the lightly doped films (Fig. 3, top panel) grown at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  dominantly consisted of hematite. Weak bands at 538 and  $668~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$ , characteristic of magnetite, were also present, though. In the film grown using  $\\mathrm{MgO:Fe_2O_3}$  cycling ratio of 1:100 at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , the relative significance of the magnetite bands was increased compared to the non- doped films, although  $\\mathrm{Mg}$  was not detected in the EDX spectra of those films. In the non- doped film grown at  $375^{\\circ}C$ , the Raman spectra were changed, revealing the dominance of magnetite (not shown), with some implications from maghemite  $(720~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}})$  as well as those of hematite  $(1320~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}})$ . However, the significances of both magnhemite and hematite bands were decreased after annealing. Furthermore, in the films grown using  $\\mathrm{MgO:Fe_2O_3}$  cycling ratio of 2:100 at  $375^{\\circ}C$  (Mg/Fe atomic ratio of 0.017), the significance of the magnetite bands became stronger, especially that at  $668~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$  (Fig. 3, middle panel). In this film, the relatively weaker decrease of the bands at around  $1400~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$  after annealing just might be connected to the contribution of maghemite. In these kinds of films, formation of the magnesioferrite phase is also not to be excluded, based on the shoulder at  $700~\\mathrm{cm^{- 1}}$ . According to the Raman results, it seems that the films grown using  $\\mathrm{MgO:Fe_2O_3}$  cycling ratio of 5:100 (Mg/Fe atomic ratio of ca. 0.05) at  $425^{\\circ}C$  were a mixture of hematite and magnetite, whereas the films grown at  $375^{\\circ}C$  mainly consisted of magnetite (Fig. 3, bottom panel). In the spectra, several peaks implied the presence of the maghemite phase. This phase was not clearly detected by GIXRD. Also, in the as- deposited films grown at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , magnetite was not recognized by GIXRD, whereas Raman indicated the presence of the magnetite as an additional phase.

The Verwey transition can be used for identification of magnetite in pure or mixed phase samples.

The transition lost its prominence in as- deposited films, in relatively disordered films grown at the lowest temperatures examined and in films containing relatively higher amounts of magnesium oxide.
