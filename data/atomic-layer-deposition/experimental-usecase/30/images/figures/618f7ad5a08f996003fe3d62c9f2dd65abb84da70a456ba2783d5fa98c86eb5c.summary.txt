The Raman spectroscopy charts display the intensity of various peaks at specific wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) corresponding to different phases of iron oxides (α-Fe₂O₃, γ-Fe₂O₃, Fe₃O₄) and silicon dioxide (SiO₂). The top chart shows the spectrum of FGA, while the bottom two charts compare the spectra at 375°C and 425°C.
