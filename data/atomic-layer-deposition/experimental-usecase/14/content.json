TMDs show tunable bandgap, good air- stability, and high carrier mobility and can be applied in transistors [1- 4], photodetectors [5], computing technologies [6, 7], memory [8, 9], RF [10- 12], and heterojunction synapse [13, 14]. However, there are still many challenges, including (1) realization of large wafer- scale deposition, (2) a controllable p- type doping method for TMD films, (3) reducing Schottky barrier- induced Fermi level pinning at the metal/TMDs contacts, and (4) high- quality high- k/TMD interface. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an effective way to synthesize single crystalline TMDs films [15- 17], but wafer- scale deposition and precisely- controlled thickness of TMDs films are difficult to achieve via CVD. Because TMD films are too thin for p- type doping by ion implantation [18- 21], a variety of different approaches have been pursued, including charge transfer doping by physical adsorption of molecules or salts on surface [22- 25], and metal oxides  $(\\mathrm{MoO}_3)$  [26] or metal- induced inversion (Tungsten) [27, 28] of  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  through interfacial interactions.

At the initial stage, the  $\\mathrm{WCl}_6$  and HMDST vapor were exposed directly onto the sapphire substrates and  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  layers were formed laterally on sapphire substrates. The subsequent layers were deposited onto the initial  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  layer to connect the isolated flakes and form films. Considering this, a postannealing process would be beneficial for improving film quality. The as- deposited  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  films were annealed at  $950^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for  $2\\mathrm{h}$  in sulfur atmosphere. The XPS spectra of as- deposited and annealed  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  films are shown in Figure 2(a). The fine spectra of as- deposited  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  contained two pairs of W 4f peaks, representing  $\\mathrm{WS}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$ , respectively. The higher coordination number of W atom in  $\\mathrm{WS}_3$  than that in  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  results a shift towards higher binding energy, with the binding energies of  $\\mathrm{W}^{6 + 4}\\bar{\\mathrm{f}}^{7 / 2}$  and  $\\mathrm{W}^{6 + 4}\\bar{\\mathrm{f}}^{7 / 2}$  being  $38.7\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $36.68\\mathrm{eV}$  and those of  $\\mathrm{W}^{4 + 4}\\bar{\\mathrm{f}}^{7 / 2}$  and  $\\mathrm{W}^{4 + 4}\\bar{\\mathrm{f}}^{7 / 2}$  being  $35.22\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $33.08\\mathrm{eV}$ , respectively. Similarly, the fine spectra of as- deposited  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  showed two pairs of S 2p peaks. The positions of the  $\\mathrm{S}_22\\mathrm{p}^{1 / 2}$  and  $\\mathrm{S}_22\\mathrm{p}^{3 / 2}$  peaks for  $\\mathrm{W}^{6 + }$ - S bonding were at  $164.54\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $163.64\\mathrm{eV}$ , while the positions of the  $\\mathrm{S}_12\\mathrm{p}^{1 / 2}$  and  $\\mathrm{S}_12\\mathrm{p}^{3 / 2}$  peaks for  $\\mathrm{W}^{4 + }$ - S bonding were at  $164.02\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $163.04\\mathrm{eV}$ , respectively. XPS analysis for as- deposited  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  films shows the films to be a mixture of  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{WS}_3$  and the stoichiometric ratio of W/S was about  $1:2.7$ . A postannealing process in S atmosphere at  $950^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for 2 hours improves film crystallinity. After annealing, the fine spectra of W 4f exhibited only one pair of W  $4\\bar{\\mathrm{f}}^{7 / 2}$  and W  $4\\bar{\\mathrm{f}}^{7 / 2}$  peaks, indicating  $\\mathrm{WS}_3$  components decomposed to  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$ , along with a similar result for S 2p spectra, both without characteristic peaks indicative of  $\\mathrm{W}^{6 + }$ - S bonding. As a result, the stoichiometric ratio of W/S was reduced to  $1:2.1$ , with the help of desulfurization and improved film crystallinity. The full spectra of as- deposited and annealed  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  are shown in Fig S2. To further investigate the crystallinity of as- deposited and annealed  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  films, Raman spectroscopy was performed. After annealing, the relative intensity of the  $\\mathrm{A_{1g}}$  and  $\\mathrm{E}^{12}\\mathrm{g} + 2\\mathrm{LA}(\\mathrm{M})$  peaks for annealed  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  was much higher than that of as- deposited  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  (Fig. S3), confirming the improved film crystallinity after annealing. Therefore, subsequent  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  films in this paper have undergone a postannealing process. In addition, when increasing  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  film thickness from 250 cycle to 500 cycle, the separation between the  $\\mathrm{A1g}$  and  $\\mathrm{E}^{12}\\mathrm{g} + 2\\mathrm{LA}(\\mathrm{M})$  peaks increased from  $64.2\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  to  $69.5\\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , demonstrating good thickness controllability for ALD grown  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$ , as shown in Figure 2(b).

The thickness of the annealed 400- cycle  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  film was  $4.6\\mathrm{nm}$ , and a cross- sectional TEM image of a  $3.7\\mathrm{nm}$ $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  film is shown in Fig. S4. Preparing monolayer films is very challenging due to the growth mechanism of ALD TMD films.

ALD  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films  $(20\\mathrm{nm})$  were used as high- k dielectrics. The equivalent oxide thickness was  $13\\mathrm{nm}$ . The transfer characteristic of 8- layer  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  n- FET is shown in Figure 4(b), with  $V_d$  varying from  $0.1\\mathrm{V}$  to  $0.5\\mathrm{V}$ , while the output characteristics with  $V_g$  vary from  $1\\mathrm{V}$  to  $5\\mathrm{V}$ . The transfer on- current of  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  n- FET reached as high as  $0.4\\mu \\mathrm{A} / \\mu \\mathrm{m}$  at  $V_d = 0.5\\mathrm{V}$ , and the on- off ratio was up to  $10^5$ . The detailed mobility of 30 tested  $\\mathrm{WS}_2$  n- FETs is also plotted in Figure 4(b).
