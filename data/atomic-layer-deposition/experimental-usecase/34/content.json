        "text": "ABSTRACT: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Li- containing thin films is deemed as highly relevant for the development of next- generation Li- ion batteries. Lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS), as Li- containing precursor, is preferred over the widely used lithium tert- butoxide because of its lower melting point of  $70^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . However, the presence of silyl groups in the LiHMDS chemical structure can result in the undesired incorporation of Si in the film. Therefore, understanding the reaction mechanism of LiHMDS is required to control its dual- source behavior and grow Si- free Li- containing thin films. For this purpose LiHMDS was combined with  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma or water as coreactant. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that using  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma as coreactant results in linear growth and Si- containing films, whereas using  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as coreactant leads to fast, nonsurface- reaction- limited growth and Si- free films. To shed light on the role of the coreactant on the reaction mechanism of LiHMDS, in situ studies by time- resolved quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) were performed on the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ - based ALD processes. Measurements taken during full ALD cycles and half- cycles were carefully compared to identify which half- cycle surface reaction products lead to silicon incorporation in the film. The QMS results of the LiHMDS +  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  process showed that LiHMDS both chemisorbs and physisorbs. Furthermore, it is concluded that Si incorporation occurs during the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma step, when the physisorbed ligands are combusted and Si- containing products are redeposited. This work also demonstrates that the incorporated Si can be abstracted from the film by means of a  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  plasma step following the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma step. These insights on the role of the coreactant in the synthesis of Li- containing films contribute to the development of LiHMDS- based ALD processes for Li- ion battery applications.",

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a suitable tool to improve the stability of interfaces in batteries, and its use in Li- ion battery research has increased substantially over the past decade. A key example of how ALD is applied in batteries is electrode- electrolyte interface engineering. ALD delivers uniform and conformal thin films with good control over thickness and composition, and therefore films can be grown on complex electrode structures to suppress parasitic reactions and improve battery performance. These films should be electrochemically stable and permeable to Li ions. One of the most popular materials to apply on electrodes is  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ , which has been shown to improve the cycling stability of NMC cathodes and Li metal anodes. However,  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  is a poor ionic conductor. Therefore, ALD of Li- containing films, that generally have higher ionic conductivities, is becoming more relevant. Examples of Li- based ALD materials are  $\\mathrm{LiF}_4$ ,  $\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{CO}_3$ ,  $\\mathrm{Li}_3\\mathrm{PO}_4$ , and ternary oxides such as  $\\mathrm{LiAl}_x\\mathrm{O}_y$ ,  $\\mathrm{LiNb}_x\\mathrm{O}_y$ , and  $\\mathrm{LiTi}_x\\mathrm{O}_y$ .",

Furthermore, Werbrouck et al. proposed that LiHMDS also physisorbs, and that the combustion of physisorbed LiHMDS ligands by an  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma  $(\\mathrm{O},^{31})$  might be a second source of Si incorporation.32 Whereas some publications that combine LiHMDS with  $\\mathrm{O}_2^*$  or  $\\mathrm{O}_3^*$  report Si content values up to 24 at.  $\\% ,^{30,32}$  others report negligible levels of Si.4 Interestingly, the Si levels are consistently low when the LiHMDS dose is directly followed by a  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  dose12,26 or another precursor dose, such as TMA,27 TMP27,32 or TDMAT.35 This suggests that the coreactant plays a bigger role in the Si incorporation mechanism than the surface termination.",

The effect of the coreactant is studied by combining LiHMDS with  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_2^*$ . First the film growth, stoichiometry and optical constants are discussed, focusing on differences between the two ALD processes. Subsequently, the two ALD processes are further investigated by in situ time- resolved quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) to determine the reaction products formed during film growth. We adopt a measurement procedure in which the standard ALD process is compared to the processes in which only one of the two reactants is dosed. A comparison between the full ALD cycle and the halfcycles allows to investigate the differences in reaction products for different surface terminations, and discern between the presence of reaction products and pressure- induced fluctuations in the measured QMS signal. Our results show that LiHMDS both chemisorbs and physisorbs, and that redeposition of Si- containing ligand combustion products during the plasma step is the main origin of Si incorporation in the film.

However, reactions between HMDS and surface OH- groups were found to not play a significant role in the Si incorporation in the film. Instead, it is shown that the choice of coreactant determines whether LiHMDS acts as a dual- or single- source. These insights on the reaction mechanism of LiHMDS and the role of the coreactant on its dual- source behavior may help the development of LiHMDS- based ALD processes for Li- ion battery applications.",
