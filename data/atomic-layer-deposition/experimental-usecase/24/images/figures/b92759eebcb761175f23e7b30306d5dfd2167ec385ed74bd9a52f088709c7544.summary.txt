The chart illustrates the intensity of m/e = 31 (MeO^-) over time during process cycles. It shows two distinct patterns: one labeled 'precursor only' and another labeled 'ozone only'. The 'precursor only' pattern has a consistent increase in intensity, while the 'ozone only' pattern shows a more gradual decline.
