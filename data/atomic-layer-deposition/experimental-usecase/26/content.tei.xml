<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article describes a new atomic layer deposition (ALD) method for preparing indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films using nonhalogenated precursors. The indium oxide (In 2 O 3 ) was deposited using alternating exposures to cyclopentadienyl indium (InCp) and ozone, and the tin oxide (SnO 2 ) used alternating exposures to tetrakis-(dimethylamino) tin (TDMASn) and hydrogen peroxide. By adjusting the relative number of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 ALD cycles, we deposited ITO films with well-controlled SnO 2 content. The ITO films were examined using four-point probe and Hall probe measurements, spectrophotometry, ellipsometry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction. The lowest resistivity (3 × 10 -4 Ωcm) and highest optical transparency (92%) were obtained for films containing 5% SnO 2 . The ITO films were slightly thinner and contained more SnO 2 than expected on the basis of rule-of-mixtures predictions. In situ measurements revealed that these discrepancies result from an inhibition of the In 2 O 3 growth following the SnO 2 doping layers. This new ALD method is suitable for applying ITO layers on very high aspect ratio nanoporous membranes to be used in photovoltaic or spectroelectrochemical applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a transparent conducting oxide material with a wide range of uses. Thin films of ITO are used in transparent electrodes for flat panel displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. ITO is also used as a heat-reflecting layer to improve the energy efficiency of architectural glass. ITO thin films can be deposited in a variety of ways including sputtering, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> spray pyrolysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> sol-gel methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> chemical vapor deposition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> pulsed laser deposition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> and atomic layer deposition (ALD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> ALD is a thin film growth method utilizing alternating, self-limiting chemical reactions between gaseous precursors and a solid surface to deposit materials in an atomic layer-bylayer fashion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> This method can produce films with exquisite control over thickness and composition and allows precise coatings to be applied on all exposed surfaces of nanoporous substrates such as aerogels <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> or mesoporous membranes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> ALD ITO films have been prepared previously using InCl 3 , SnCl 4 , and either H 2 O 7 or H 2 O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> as the oxygen source. However, this method suffers from limitations including low growth rates, high deposition temperatures, low volatility of InCl 3 , and the inconvenience of using halogenated precursors. The chlorinated precursors as well as the HCl byproduct are corrosive and can etch the substrates and damage the deposition equipment. For instance, large exposures to InCl 3 can etch the deposited In 2 O 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> This behavior is especially problematic when trying to infiltrate porous substrates where large reactant exposures are needed to ensure diffusion throughout the substrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> Finally, halogenated precursors can form agglomerates during large exposures, leading to nonuniform deposits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> We have recently started using ALD techniques to apply metal oxide coatings onto porous supports such as anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes to synthesize dye-sensitized solar cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> As part of this effort, we have developed new methods for depositing ALD In 2 O 3 films using alternating exposures to cyclopentadienyl indium (InCp) and ozone <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> and also SnO 2 films using alternating exposures to tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin (TDMASn) and H 2 O 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> In this article, we demonstrate how the ALD procedures for In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 can be combined to make ITO thin films. We use in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) measurements to investigate the ALD growth mechanism. ITO films are deposited onto Si(100) and glass substrates and examined using variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), optical transmittance, four-point probe and Hall probe measurements, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Finally, we demonstrate that these methods are capable of conformally coating very high aspect ratio AAO membranes suitable for solar cell electrodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Section</head><p>The ALD experiments used a viscous flow reactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> constructed from a circular, stainless steel flow tube with an inside diameter of 5 cm to hold the substrates for film growth as well as the QCM. Ultrahigh purity (99.999%) nitrogen carrier gas continuously passed through the flow tube at a mass flow rate of 360 sccm and a pressure of 1 Torr. A constant reactor temperature was maintained by temperature controllers connected to resistive heaters attached to the outside of the reactor. Four separate heating zones were used to establish a uniform temperature profile along the length of the flow tube to minimize artifacts caused by temperature transients during the QCM measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> SnO 2 ALD was performed using alternating exposures to TDMASn (Gelest, &gt;95% purity) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 , Aldrich, 50 wt % in water). In 2 O 3 ALD was performed using alternating exposures to InCp (Strem, electronic grade 99.999+% In) and ozone. The ozone was produced using a commercial ozone generator (Ozone Engineering L11) using a feed of ultrahigh purity oxygen at a flow rate of 400 sccm to produce ∼10% ozone in oxygen. The TDMASn and InCp were held in separate stainless steel bubblers maintained at 40 °C, and the tubing connecting the bubblers to the ALD reactor was heated to 150 °C to prevent condensation of the precursors on the reactor walls. Ultrahigh purity nitrogen at a mass flow rate of 60 sccm was sent through the bubblers during the reactant exposures and was diverted to bypass the bubblers following the reactant exposures.</p><p>The ALD timing sequences can be expressed as t1-t2-t3-t4 where t1 is the exposure time for the first precursor, t2 is the purge time following the first exposure, t3 is the exposure time for the second precursor, and t4 is the purge time following the exposure to the second precursor with units in seconds. On the basis of our previous studies, the timing sequence used for In 2 O 3 ALD was 2-4-2-2, and the timing sequence used for SnO 2 ALD was 1-5-1-5. ITO ALD was accomplished by alternating between the InCp/O 3 cycles for In 2 O 3 ALD and the TDMASn/H 2 O 2 cycles for SnO 2 ALD. The composition of the films was controlled by adjusting the percentage of SnO 2 cycles that were substituted for In 2 O 3 cycles.</p><p>To enable in situ measurements during the ITO ALD, a QCM was installed in the ALD reactor in place of the substrates. These studies utilized a Maxtek BSH-150 bakeable sensor, AT-cut quartz sensor crystals with a polished front surface (Colorado Crystal Corporation, part no. CCAT1BK-1007-000), and a Maxtek TM400 film thickness monitor interfaced to a personal computer. The ALD reactor was also equipped with a QMS (Stanford Research Systems RGA300) located downstream of the QCM in a differentially pumped chamber separated from the reactor tube by a 35-µm orifice and evacuated using a 50 L/s turbomolecular pump.</p><p>The ALD films were deposited on 2 × 2 cm 2 Si(100) and glass substrates. Before loading, the substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonicator using acetone and then 2-propanol and blown dry using nitrogen. After loading, the substrates were allowed to outgas in the ALD reactor for 10 min at the deposition temperature (typically 275 °C) in 1 Torr of flowing ultrahigh purity nitrogen. Next, the substrates were cleaned in situ using a 60-s exposure to 10% ozone in oxygen at a pressure of 2 Torr and a mass flow rate of 400 sccm.</p><p>In our previous study of In 2 O 3 ALD, we observed a reactor conditioning effect in which the thicknesses of In 2 O 3 films deposited immediately following the growth of a different material, such as Al 2 O 3 or SnO 2 , were thinner than expected. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> To compensate for this effect, we always deposited an In 2 O 3 buffer layer on the inside of the reactor using ∼100 InCp/O 3 cycles following deposition of a different material.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>A. Growth of ITO Films. To deposit a mixed-oxide material such as ITO by ALD, it must be possible to deposit the component oxides (In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 ) at a common temperature or range of temperatures. In other words, the ALD temperature "windows" for the component materials must overlap. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows that In 2 O 3 can be deposited between 200 and 450 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> At lower temperatures the O 3 decomposition shuts off, thereby preventing deposition, and at higher temperatures the InCp decomposes. SnO 2 can be deposited between 50 and 325 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> The lower temperature limit is fixed by the TDMASn vaporization temperature of 40 °C, while at higher temperatures the TDMASn begins to decompose. As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows, there should be a temperature window for ITO ALD between 200 and 325 °C. Consequently, a deposition temperature of 275 °C was selected for the initial experiments.</p><p>A series of ITO films were prepared on Si(100) using 300 ALD cycles at 275 °C in which the percentage of SnO 2 cycles was varied between 0 and 25%. The total thicknesses of these films were determined using VASE measurements, and the effective thicknesses of SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 for the films were calculated from XRF measurements using the calibration procedure described in the Experimental Section. The ITO growth rates determined from the VASE and XRF results are given by the circles and triangles, respectively, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, and the solid line guides the eye. The ITO growth rate decreases steadily from 1.69 Å/cycle for 0% SnO 2 to 1.07 Å/cycle for 25% SnO 2 . There is fairly good agreement between the VASE and XRF growth rate measurements for these ITO films. The dashed line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the anticipated ITO growth rates based on a rule-of-mixtures formula and reveals that the measured growth rates are below the rule-of-mixture estimates for all of the ITO films.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> presents the SnO 2 mol % for the ITO films versus the percentage of SnO 2 cycles as determined by XRF. The SnO 2 content increases steadily from 1.2 mol % SnO 2 at 2% SnO 2 cycles to 41 mol % SnO 2 at 25% SnO 2 cycles. The dashed line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the expected SnO 2 content based on a ruleof-mixtures formula. Over the entire range of SnO 2 cycles, the SnO 2 content is higher than the predicted values.</p><p>In situ QCM and QMS measurements were performed to investigate the discrepancies in thickness and composition.    exposures that immediately follow the SnO 2 ALD cycles, and this O 3 signal persists for approximately 8-10 cycles. Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the SnO 2 cycles inhibit the subsequent In 2 O 3 ALD, and this may result from the suppression of O 3 decomposition by the SnO 2 . In our previous In 2 O 3 ALD study, we observed a reactor conditioning effect in which the thicknesses of In 2 O 3 films deposited immediately following Al 2 O 3 growth were thinner than expected. To compensate for this effect, we always deposited an In 2 O 3 buffer layer on the inside of the reactor following deposition of a different material. Evidently, the SnO 2 deposited during a single SnO 2 cycle is sufficient to suppress the O 3 decomposition necessary to sustain the In 2 O 3 growth. The reduced In 2 O 3 growth observed using QCM and QMS explains why the ITO films are thinner than expected (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>), and also why the ITO films contain more SnO 2 than expected (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</p><p>Despite the peculiar effect of the SnO 2 on the In 2 O 3 ALD, it is still possible to deposit ITO films with excellent control over film thickness and SnO 2 content. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows the ITO thickness versus the number of ALD cycles measured using VASE for films prepared with 5% SnO 2 cycles at 275 °C. This plot yields a growth rate for ITO of 1.60 Å/cycle. This value is substantially larger than the growth rates of 0.20-0.32 Å/cycle measured previously for the ALD of ITO using halogenated precursors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> A more detailed examination of the thickness data in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> reveals that the ITO growth rate increases slightly with the number of ALD cycles from 1.35 Å/cycle at 50 cycles to 1.65 Å/cycle at 1000 cycles. Gradual changes in ALD growth rates have been observed previously for nanocrystalline materials in which the morphology or crystal size evolves with film thickness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> The filled circles in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> show the ITO growth rate versus the deposition temperature measured by VASE for films prepared using 300 cycles with 5% SnO 2 cycles. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> demonstrates that the experimentally determined temperature window for ITO ALD matches very closely with the temperature range predicted from the component oxides. In particular, the ITO growth rate remains nearly constant at 1.35-1.51 Å/cycle in the temperature range 200-325 °C. The ITO growth rate falls off below 200 °C, and this probably results from the abrupt onset of O 3 decomposition at 200 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> The ITO growth rate increases substantially above 325 °C, and this undoubtedly signals the TDMASn thermal decomposition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> B. Properties of ITO Films. Once the growth behavior of the ALD ITO films was understood, we proceeded to measure the properties of the films to determine the effect of the deposition conditions on the resistivity, transparency, and morphology of the ITO. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref> shows the ITO resistivity versus percent SnO 2 cycles determined using four-point probe measurements of films prepared on glass at 275 °C using 300 ALD cycles. Initially, the ITO resistivity decreases dramatically from 1.4 × 10 -2 Ωcm at 0% SnO 2 cycles to 3.9 × 10 -4 Ωcm at 5% SnO 2 cycles, and then increases slightly to 1.1 × 10 -3 Ωcm at 25% SnO 2 cycles.</p><p>Hall probe measurements performed on the samples prepared on glass confirmed that the ITO films are n-doped, and the Hall probe resistivity values were nearly identical to those obtained using the four-point probe. The carrier concentration and mobility values obtained using the Hall probe (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7b</ref>) reveal that the decrease in resistivity with SnO 2 doping can be mostly attributed to an increase in carrier concentration. The carrier concentration increases from 1.3 × 10 19 cm -3 at 0% SnO 2 cycles to 4.0 × 10 20 cm -3 at 5% SnO 2 cycles. In contrast, the mobility  only increases from 23 to 49 cm 2 /Vs over this range. The mobility of the undoped In 2 O 3 is unusually low; however, this film is only 51-nm thick and In 2 O 3 mobilities are thicknessdependent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> We measure a more typical mobility of 72 cm 2 / Vs for an In 2 O 3 with a thicknkess of 200 nm. The electrical characteristics of the ITO films prepared using 5% SnO 2 cycles in this study are comparable to values obtained for ALD ITO films deposited previously using metal chloride precursors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> In addition, these electrical transport values are very similar to the values measured for commercially available ITO films prepared using sputtering.</p><p>It is interesting to compare the carrier concentration determined by the Hall probe measurements with the actual concentration of Sn atoms in the ITO films measured by XRF. The ratio of these values is known as the doping efficiency, where a value of 100% implies that every Sn atom contributes one free electron. For the ITO film prepared using 5% SnO 2 cycles, the Hall probe measured a carrier concentration n ) 4.0 × 10 20 cm -3 , while XRF yielded 4.9% 2 for this film. Using the atomic density of bulk In 2 O 3 , this composition corresponds to a Sn atom density of 7.6 × 10 20 cm -3 so that the doping efficiency is 53%. This number compares favorably with ITO films of similar Sn content prepared by sol-gel techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> It is thought that the remaining 47% of the Sn atoms forms neutral clusters such as Sn 2 O 4 that do not contribute to the ITO conductivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> Perhaps by doping the In 2 O 3 using a different SnO 2 precursor with a lower growth rate than TD-MASn, the Sn atoms could be spaced farther apart to avoid forming neutral clusters, thereby increasing the doping efficiency.</p><p>Next, the ITO resistivity was evaluated versus the film thickness and deposition temperature. The resistivity of the ITO films prepared on glass at 275 °C using 5% SnO 2 cycles was measured by four-point probe versus the number of ITO cycles as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8a</ref>. The ITO resistivity remains relatively constant at 2.7 × 10 -4 to 4.4 × 10 -4 Ωcm over the range 100-1000 ALD cycles. This range corresponds to ITO thicknesses of 13-162 nm. Only at very small numbers of ALD cycles does the resistivity of the ITO increase, and for 40 cycles (5.6 nm) the resistivity reaches 2.6 × 10 -2 Ωcm. The ITO resistivity  was also measured by four-point probe as a function of the deposition temperature for films deposited on glass using 300 ALD cycles with 5% SnO 2 cycles. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8b</ref> demonstrates that the ITO resistivity decreases slightly with increasing deposition temperature from 4.4 × 10 -4 to 3.0 × 10 -4 Ωcm between 225 and 350 °C. The increase in resistivity observed at higher temperatures probably results from impurities caused by the TDMASn decomposition. At temperatures below 225 °C, the films are much thinner and probably contain little indium, and thus the resistivity is closer to that of SnO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> shows optical transmission measurements for the ITO films prepared on glass as a function of the percentage of SnO 2 cycles obtained by integrating the transmission spectra over the wavelength range 370-1000 nm. The transmission spectra were referenced to an uncoated glass substrate. These films were deposited at 275 °C using 300 ALD cycles. Although the data are somewhat scattered, the overall trend is an increase in transmittance from ∼80% at 0% SnO 2 cycles to an average value of ∼90% at 16% SnO 2 cycles. The increased transmittance is due in part to a blue shift in the absorption edge of the transmission curves with increasing SnO 2 content known as the Burstein-Moss effect. As the conduction band fills, the Fermi level exceeds the conduction band minimum and a larger photon energy is required for absorption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Alternatively, a decrease in surface roughness with increasing Sn content might reduce optical scattering and produce the effect shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>. VASE measurements for the 5% ITO films deposited on Si-(100) yielded a refractive index at 633 nm of n ) 1.89.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> shows the X-ray diffraction profile measured for an ITO film deposited on glass using 1000 ALD cycles with 5% SnO 2 cycles at 275 °C. The indices and peak positions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> are taken from PDF No. 00-006-0416 for cubic In 2 O 3 . The ITO deposits in a polycrystalline form with a cubic In 2 O 3 structure, and the most prominent orientation is the [111] direction. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> shows an AFM image of an ITO film with a thickness of 89 nm deposited at 275 °C using 600 cycles with 5% SnO 2 and yields an rms roughness of 8.9 nm. As expected from the XRD measurements, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> shows a polycrystalline morphology. In addition, a small number of unusually tall features (10-40 nm) are seen on the surface. These large    crystals might explain the dominant (222) peak seen in XRD.</p><p>Previous ALD studies of ITO observed neither the large crystals nor the dominant (222) peak. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> shows SEM images of an ALD ITO film prepared on Si(100) using 600 cycles with 5% SnO 2 cycles at 275 °C. The plan-view image (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12a</ref>) shows a surface that is uniformly decorated with platelike crystals in addition to taller, diamond-shaped crystals that correspond to the tall features in the AFM image. Additional SEM and AFM measurements showed that the height and number of these tall, diamond-shaped crystals increased with increasing ITO film thickness. The crosssectional SEM image (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12b</ref>) yields an ITO film thickness of 82 ( 8 nm, in good agreement with the thickness of 88.7 nm obtained using VASE.</p><p>C. Fabrication of High Surface Area ITO. We used the ALD methods described in the preceding sections to synthesize high surface area transparent, conducting electrodes that could be used in nanostructured photovoltaic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> or spectrophotochemical <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> applications. First, a thin ITO coating was deposited on a commercial AAO membrane that completely infiltrated the AAO pores to create a conformal, uniform coating with a thickness of 9.7 nm. This process used 58 ALD cycles with 10% SnO 2 cycles at a temperature of 275 °C with the timing sequence 12-10-60-5 for In 2 O 3 and 10-10-10-10 for SnO 2 . Next, the AAO was mounted in a fixture that limited deposition to the front, 20-nm pore side of the membrane, and an ITO film with a thickness of 161 nm was deposited. The function of this thick layer was to seal off the small pores and also to provide a low resistance contact to the electrode. The thick layer used 1000 cycles with 5% SnO 2 cycles at a temperature of 275 °C with the timing sequence 2-4-2-2 for In 2 O 3 and 1-5-1-5 for SnO 2 .</p><p>Cross-sectional SEM images of the resulting electrode are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13a</ref> demonstrates that the 20-nm pores of the membrane are completely sealed, while the underlying 200-nm pores are still open beneath the thick coating. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13b</ref> is a higher resolution image showing that the inside surfaces of the pores are decorated with ITO nanocrystals. The coated membrane had a 5 Ω resistance through the membrane, a 15 Ω/0 sheet resistance on the thickly coated side, and an optical transparency of ∼70%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We have demonstrated a new method for depositing ITO thin films by ALD using alternating InCp/O 3 exposures for In 2 O 3 and TDMASn/H 2 O 2 exposures for SnO 2 . By adjusting the relative number of In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 ALD cycles, we deposited ITO films with precise control over the thickness and SnO 2 content. ITO films with a thickness of 42 nm deposited on glass using 5% SnO 2 cycles exhibited a resistivity of 3 × 10 -4 Ωcm and an optical transparency of 92%. The ITO films were slightly thinner and contained more SnO 2 than predicted, and in situ measurements revealed that these discrepancies result from an inhibition of the In 2 O 3 growth following the SnO 2 cycles. We have used this new ALD method to apply conformal ITO layers on very high aspect ratio nanoporous membranes. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>2 and In 2 O 3 films were prepared on Si(100) substrates and the thicknesses of these films were determined using VASE measurements. Next, the Sn and In signals from these films were measured by XRF. By plotting the XRF signals for Sn and In versus the corresponding SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 film thicknesses measured using VASE, we obtained the calibration factors (XRF counts/Å) for Sn and In. These calibration factors were used to extract the effective thicknesses of SnO 2 and In 2 O 3 from XRF measurements performed on the ITO films, and the Sn and In contents were calculated using the known atomic densities of these materials. AAO membranes (Whatman Anodisc 13) were also coated by ITO to evaluate the suitability of the new ALD ITO technique to conformally coat porous materials. The AAO membranes had a thickness of 70 µm and a pore diameter d ) 200 nm across most of the membrane thickness which transitioned to a 1-2µm thick layer with d ) 20 nm pores. Cross-sectional SEM analysis was performed on cleaved specimens of the coated AAO membranes.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>shows the QCM signals recorded during the ALD of ITO using 10% SnO 2 cycles at 275 °C. This figure plots the growth rate measured during each ALD cycle assuming densities of 7.19 and 6.95 g/cm 3 for the In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 , respectively. Although the steady-state growth rate measured for In 2 O 3 using the QCM is ∼1.4 Å/cycle, the In 2 O 3 growth rate drops to ∼1 Å/cycle after each SnO 2 cycle. Following the SnO 2 cycles, the In 2 O 3 growth rate increases toward the steady-state value over the following 5-7 cycles. Apparently, the SnO 2 temporarily inhibits the In 2 O 3 growth. Next, QMS experiments were performed to explore the origin for the inhibited In 2 O 3 growth following the SnO 2 cycles. Figure 5a shows the m ) 66 signal from cyclopentadiene versus time measured during the ALD of ITO using 5% SnO 2 cycles at 275 °C. The TDMASn exposures for each SnO 2 cycle are indicated in the figure. Cyclopentadiene is released exclusively during the InCp exposures, and the magnitude of the m ) 66 signal is proportional to the amount of In 2 O 3 deposited during each ALD cycle.<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> In agreement with the QCM measurements, Figure5ashows that the In 2 O 3 growth rate decreases substantially following each SnO 2 cycle, and 8-12 In 2 O 3 cycles are required for the In 2 O 3 growth rate to recover to the steadystate value.Figure5bpresents the m ) 48 signal for O 3 that was recorded simultaneously with the m ) 66 data in Figure5a. No O 3 is observed during the In 2 O 3 ALD when the In 2 O 3 growth rate has reached the steady-state value. This observation is consistent with our previous finding that O 3 decomposes on the In 2 O 3 very efficiently, and this decomposition is necessary for the In 2 O 3 growth.<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> Curiously, the m ) 48 signal returns during the O 3</figDesc></figure>
