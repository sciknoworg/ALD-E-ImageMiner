        "text": "This article describes a new atomic layer deposition (ALD) method for preparing indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films using nonhalogenated precursors. The indium oxide  $\\mathrm{(In_2O_3)}$  was deposited using alternating exposures to cyclopentadienyl indium  $\\mathrm{(InCp)}$  and ozone, and the tin oxide  $\\mathrm{(SnO_2)}$  used alternating exposures to tetrakis(dimethylamino) tin (TDMASn) and hydrogen peroxide. By adjusting the relative number of  $\\mathrm{In}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$  ALD cycles, we deposited ITO films with well- controlled  $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$  content. The ITO films were examined using four- point probe and Hall probe measurements: spectrophotometry, ellipsometry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X- ray fluorescence, and  $\\textrm{X}$  - ray diffraction. The lowest resistivity  $(3\\times 10^{- 4}\\Omega \\mathrm{cm})$  and highest optical transparency  $(92\\%)$  were obtained for films containing  $5\\%$ $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$  . The ITO films were slightly thinner and contained more  $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$  than expected on the basis of rule- of- mixtures predictions. In situ measurements revealed that these discrepancies result from an inhibition of the  $\\mathrm{In}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  growth following the  $\\mathrm{SnO_2}$  doping layers. This new ALD method is suitable for applying ITO layers on very high aspect ratio nanoporous membranes to be used in photovoltaic or spectroelectrochemical applications.",

        "text": "Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a transparent conducting oxide material with a wide range of uses. Thin films of ITO are used in transparent electrodes for flat panel displays, light- emitting diodes, and solar cells. ITO is also used as a heat- reflecting layer to improve the energy efficiency of architectural glass. ITO thin films can be deposited in a variety of ways including sputtering, spray pyrolysis, sol- gel methods, chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, and atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is a thin film growth method utilizing alternating, self- limiting chemical reactions between gaseous precursors and a solid surface to deposit materials in an atomic layer- by- layer fashion. This method can produce films with exquisite control over thickness and composition and allows precise coatings to be applied on all exposed surfaces of nanoporous substrates such as aerogels or mesoporous membranes.",
