The chart displays the signal intensity over time for two different chemical species, C5H6 (cyclopentadiene) and Ozone, using bar plots. The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis shows the signal intensity in arbitrary units (AU). The bars represent the signal intensity at specific time intervals.
