The advanced atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique makes it possible to obtain very thin layers of doped ZnO with controllable thicknesses and compositions that are compatible with the main microelectronic technologies, which further boosts the interest. The present study provides an extended analysis of the magnetooptical MO Kerr effect and the dielectric properties of (Co, Fe, or Ni)- doped ZnO films prepared by ALD. The structural, magnetooptical, and dielectric properties were considered in relation to the technological details of the ALD process and the corresponding dopant effects. All doped samples show a strong MO Kerr behavior with a substantial magnetization response and very high values of the Kerr polarization angle, especially in the case of ZnO/Fe. In addition, the results give evidence that Fe- doped ZnO also demonstrates a ferroelectric behavior. In this context, the observed rich and versatile physical nature and functionality open up new prospects for the application of these nanostructured materials in advanced electronic, spintronic, and optical devices.",

Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) (i.e., semiconductors with net spin polarization—e.g., ZnO in which magnetic TM ions substitute cations of the host semiconductor material) are especially attractive for spintronics and micro(nano)electronics as they allow realization of simultaneous control over the electronic state and carrier dynamics in the semiconductor and the robustness and coherence of the magnetic spin of the TM. Room- temperature (RT) ferromagnetism (FM) in Mn- doped p- type ZnO has been predicted by Dietl et al. First- principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) also predicted FM in the most of the 3d TM- doped ZnO materials. Soon after, RT- FM in doped ZnO was also experimentally observed, which consequently triggered intensive investigations. Several mechanisms explaining the RT FM in TM- doped ZnO films have been proposed. The most widely accepted are as follows: (i) the Ruderman- Kittel- Kasuya- Yoshida (RKKY), which results from the coupling mechanism related to the  $d$  shell electron spins mediated by conduction electrons interactions and (ii) the mechanism of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) formed by the s- d exchange interactions between the electron spin of the nanoscale defect (e.g., vacancy, secondary phase, etc.) and the electron spins of substitutional 3d TM ions.",

MO phenomena [magnetic circular dichroism, the MO Faraday effect, and the MO Kerr effect (MOKE)] are interesting both from the fundamental point of view and for the application in various devices such as information storage systems, magnetic field sensors, optical isolators, and so forth. In the MOKE technique, the change in the linear polarization of the light reflected from the magnetic surface in a direct relation to the microscale magnetic hysteresis is studied. The MOKE is a powerful tool to study the local electronic and magnetic properties of materials. Enhancement of the MOKE can be obtained by a careful design of materials (including their thickness) and structures, for example, a large Kerr rotation angle reaching several degrees was reported for structures consisting of stacked magnetic and dielectric thin films; Fabry- Perot cavities; 1D photonic crystals; and so forth.",

However, a large coercive field  $(>7\\mathrm{MV / cm})$  is needed for switching; hence, ferroelectricity in pure defect- free ZnO is difficult to observe. Incorporating optimized dopants in ZnO can induce switchable polarization more effectively and easily. Ferroelectricity in doped ZnO is usually explained with the difference in the ionic radii of dopant and  $\\mathrm{Zn^{2 + }}$  ions. Because of this difference, the dopant occupies an off- centered position, which results in the formation of a permanent electrical dipole. Therefore, ferroelectricity in doped ZnO is most often reported for dopants with a relatively smaller/larger ionic radius [e.g.,  $\\mathrm{V}^{2 + }$  (0.93 Å) and  $\\mathrm{Cr}^{3 + }$  (0.63 Å)] with respect to  $\\mathrm{Zn^{2 + }}$  (0.74 Å).

Depending on the dopant, similar trends to those observed for the coercivity appeared from the  $\\theta_{\\mathrm{Kerr}}$  distributions.

These bonds are non- collinear and rotate more easily, thus enhancing the dielectric response of the layer. The present results suggest that dipolar polarization is stronger in Fe- doped  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$ . Another mechanism that can substantially increase polarization is the charge build- up and polarization at grain boundaries and/or heterointerfaces (also known as Maxwell- Wagner polarization). From this point of view, the formation of  $\\mathrm{NiO}$  clusters in the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  matrix, which was suggested to occur in similar layers with lower  $\\mathrm{Ni}$  doping, is a possible explanation for the increased  $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$  at  $f = 10^{3} - 10^{4}\\mathrm{Hz}$ . It should be noted that the calculated static dielectric constant  $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$  of Fe- and Ni- doped  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  layers is significantly larger than that of the host  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$ , which is usually reported to be  $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}} = 8 - 9$ . Recently, Vegesna et al. attributed the increase of the static dielectric constant in magnetic n- type Co- and Mn- doped  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  layers to the contribution of BMPs to the electrical polarization. These polarons are formed by  $\\mathrm{s - d}$  exchange interaction between electron spins of the positively charged oxygen vacancy  $V_{\\mathrm{o}}^{+}$  in the BMP center and the electron spins of substitutional dopant ions. Having in mind the ferromagnetic behavior of the Fe- and Ni- doped  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$ , as observed in the previous section, it can be concluded that the increased static dielectric constant may be indeed partly due to BMPs. The dielectric response of the  $\\mathrm{ZnO / Co}$  film is significantly weaker than that of the other two films  $- \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$  is substantially smaller than that of  $\\mathrm{ZnO / Ni}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZnO / Fe}$  films; it is also smaller than that of pure  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  layers.

The results for Ni- and Co- doped layers, though showing some  $P - V$  hysteresis, are not that convincing for the existence of ferroelectricity. It should be mentioned that all layers have a relatively high dielectric loss (Figure 7b), which is due to the increased conductivity of the layers.
