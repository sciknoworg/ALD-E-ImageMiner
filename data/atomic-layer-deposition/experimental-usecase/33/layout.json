Their surface reactions were found to be complementary and self- limiting, thus providing highly uniform thicknesses and conformal coating of long, narrow holes. We propose that these ALD layers grow by a hydrogenation mechanism that should also operate during the ALD of many other metals. The use of water vapour in place of hydrogen gas gives highly uniform, conformal films of metal oxides, including lanthanum oxide. These processes should permit the improved production of many devices for which the ALD process has previously not been applicable."

One method that is particularly suitable for making uniform conformal layers is atomic layer deposition (ALD), also known as atomic layer epitaxy. An ALD process deposits thin layers of solid materials by using two or more different vapour- phase reactants. First, a dose of vapour from one precursor is brought to the surface of a substrate onto which a film is to be deposited. Then any excess unreacted vapour of that reactant is pumped away. Next, a vapour dose of the second reactant is brought to the surface and allowed to react, and the excess is pumped away. This cycle of steps normally deposits a monolayer or less of material, although one case of a multilayer ALD process has been reported. These cycles can be repeated to build up thicker films."

Complementarity of the surface reactions means that each of the two reactants must prepare the surface for its reaction with the other vapour, so that the deposition cycles can be repeated. Self- limiting means that the amount of material deposited in each of the reaction steps is uniform over the surface, provided that at least a minimum, that is, saturating, amount reaches each part of the surface. Because of this self- limiting character, ALD reactions produce coatings with very uniform thickness even if the flux of vapour is distributed non- uniformly over the surface. The uniformity of an ALD film thickness extends not only over flat substrate surfaces but also into very narrow holes and trenches; that is, the films are highly conformal. ALD reactions also ensure reproducible control of thickness, by counting the number of reaction cycles."

Many potential applications of ALD are, however, frustrated by the lack of ALD processes for most pure metals. Tungsten, ruthenium and platinum are the only metals that have been successfully deposited from molecular precursors by complementary, self- limiting ALD reactions. ALD copper grew only on platinum substrates. ALD of titanium, tantalum and aluminium uses atomic hydrogen as a reactant, which limits the step coverage attainable in deep trenches because of the rapid recombination of hydrogen atoms on surfaces. It is also difficult to design an ALD apparatus to deliver hydrogen atoms over large substrate areas without plasma damage to the substrates and without causing long cycle times because of inefficient paths for gas flow."

In contrast, under- saturating doses of hydrogen produced thinner films over the whole deposition zone, showing that the reaction of hydrogen with the surface is slower than the reactions of the metal precursors. This observation corroborates the fact that much higher hydrogen exposures are needed to saturate the ALD reactions (Table 2)."

The dose is the amount of precursor that was supplied in each cycle to complete the reaction with the surface. The exposure is the flux of precursor to the surface that causes the reaction with the surface to go to competition. The exposure is thus inersely related to the speed of the reaction between the precursor and the surface. The units of exposure are pressure multiplied by the duration of exposure. When the pressure units are too high the time units are microseconds, the units of exposure are called Langmuirs."

The increasing growth rate for cobalt as a function of growth temperature (Fig. 5) suggests that hydrogen adsorption is not the rate- determining step. A similar temperature dependence has been observed for ALD of W (refs 6, 7) and Ru (ref. 8) metals, even though the chemistry of these ALD processes is quite different. During the ALD of the pure metals, the chemisorption of the metal acetamidinate precursors must involve the chemisorbed hydrogen atoms, because without the hydrogen pretreatment the metal precursors do not chemisorb on the clean metal surfaces, as shown by quartz crystal microbalance measurements in situ. The chemisorbed hydrogen atoms then react with the metal precursors to cleave the metal- ligand bonds; this step might involve an energy barrier that contributes to the temperature dependence in Fig. 5. In addition, the released ligands are at least partly hydrogenated, because some lines in the NMR spectra of the volatile reaction byproducts can be assigned to hydrogenated ligands.
