The same properties of zirconium and hafnium oxide that make them leading candidates for a gate oxide replacement also give them a high potential for application as insulating dielectrics in the capacitive elements in many memory devices such as DRAM. Both hafnium and zirconium oxides have high dielectric constants (at least 4 times that of silicon dioxide); thus, a thick film of hafnium or zirconium oxide can be used to achieve the high performance resulting from a thin silicon dioxide layer without the high leakage current associated with a thin layer of material. Thermal instability might render thin silicon dioxide layers unusable even for applications in which a high leakage current is acceptable."

High refractory oxides such as those of zirconium and hafnium also find uses in optical applications as catalysts and, because of their hardness and thermal stability, as protective coatings. Future DRAM designs might use capacitors made from long narrow holes with high aspect ratios in place of conventional flat surface capacitors. Atomic layer chemical vapor deposition (ALD) is an ideal method for depositing smooth, conformal films, and it offers the additional benefit of precise thickness and composition control."

Nitrogen gas was purified using Millipore inert gas purifier model VPMV200SI, ratioed to reduce water and oxygen to less than 1 ppb each. Unreacted precursors and reaction products were removed through the opposite end (exhaust) of the reactor with a rotary vane vacuum pump. Substrates were also introduced into and removed from the reactor via a removable flange at the exhaust end of the reactor.

The first 10 pulses and the 12th did not cause a mass gain, whereas the 11th pulse resulted in the entire mass gain observed after the metal precursor pulse. This result further emphasizes the high rate of the reaction, and it was used to measure the vapor pressure and place an upper limit on the minimum exposure required for substrate saturation. The small perturbations observed after every precursor dose (even those not contributing a net mass increase) are due to temperature alterations of the QCM probe caused by gas flow variations occurring during precursor introduction."

This first step involves the breakage of the metal-nitrogen bond and the formation of a metal-oxygen bond concomitant with the deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl by the amide (the metal ligand) to form a volatile dialkylamine byproducts. Both events are highly exothermic as amines are orders of magnitude less acidic than alcohols (hence more basic) and metal nitrogen bonds are much weaker than metal oxygen bonds. The second step of the proposed reaction involves the same energetic considerations as the first step. In the second step, water reacts with the surface-bound metal amides to regenerate the surface hydroxyls and form additional dialkylamines. The QCM data are consistent with the proposed mechanism, as the first step results in a mass increase [two hydrogen atoms being replaced by a metal atom and two dialkylamides "

Although nitrogen gas was constantly flowing during the course of all depositions, no precursors were introduced into the reactor during the purge. At all deposition temperatures, it was found that, when the purge was below a minimum time (dependent on the gas flow rate), thicker film was deposited at the reactor entrance and thinner film near the exit. The minimum purge time required to maintain thickness uniformity is indicative of the time required to remove unreacted gas- phase and surface- physisorbed precursors from the reactor. Gas- phase (and non- self- limiting) reactions are prevalent in CVD processes, and in the limit of no purge, an ALD process becomes CVD. As is to be expected during a CVD process using highly reactive precursors, the film thickness is usually greater where the precursors are first introduced into the reactor. An increase in the gas flow speed is effectively a decrease in the time required to remove gas from the reactor; thus, higher gas flow"

The velocity at which a gas moves through a pipe is proportional to the pressure gradient along the pipe. If the pressures at both ends of the pipe are the same, then fluid (continuum) flow will cease. Diffusional flow from the precursor vessel to the QCM probe was on the order of minutes at the operating pressure used to measure the vapor pressure. If the probe were saturated within a few seconds, it could be concluded that the vapor pressure in the precursor source was greater than the reactor pressure. During this experiment, both valves between the precursor reservoir and the reactor were in the open state. For example, tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium(IV) vapor at a temperature of "

                                    "content": "The results reported here show that the alkylamides of hafnium and zirconium provide convenient and effective ALD precursors to hafnium and zirconium oxide thin films. The deposition of metal oxide from these precursors was done at unprecedented low temperatures, yet the films produced had no detectable impurities. These surface reactions are extremely rapid, irreversible, and self- limiting. These precursors are also more volatile than any other reported hafnium or zirconium precursors. In addition to their high volatility, all of the amide precursors are liquid under the vaporization conditions described; this is a clear advantage over solid precursors in that the synthesis, purification, and handling of the precursor is simplified, the vaporization is more reproducible, and no dust or powder contamination of substrates occurs. Also, alkylamides produce less corrosive byproducts compared to chloride precursors, which produce hydrochloric acid. The ALD promise of smooth, pure, and highly conformal films of hafnium and zirconium oxides has been realized using these amide precursors."
