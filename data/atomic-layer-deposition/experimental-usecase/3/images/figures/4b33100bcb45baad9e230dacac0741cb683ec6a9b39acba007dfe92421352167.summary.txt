The image shows two chemical reactions involving zirconium (Zr) complexes. In the first reaction, a Zr complex with dimethylamino groups (Me2N) reacts with water molecules (H2O), forming a new complex where the oxygen atoms from the water molecules coordinate to the Zr atom. In the second reaction, another Zr complex with dimethylamino groups reacts with water molecules, resulting in a different coordination pattern where the oxygen atoms form a tetrahedral arrangement around the Zr atom.
