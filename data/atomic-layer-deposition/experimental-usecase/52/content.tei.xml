<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of the remaining challenges in the field of portable electronics is the miniaturization of lithium-ion batteries. To prepare all-solidstate batteries with a sufficient high storage capacity it is vital to prepare high quality thin films for battery stacks on 3D-structured substrates. A remote plasma atomic layer deposition (ALD) process has therefore been developed for LiCoO 2 which can serve as a cathode material. A combination of CoCp 2 as cobalt precursor, LiO t Bu as lithium precursor and O 2 plasma as oxidant source was used to create super-cycles to deposit LiCoO 2 from Co 3 O 4 and Li 2 CO 3 cycles. The thin films were deposited at a temperature of 325 • C and showed linear growth with a rate of 0.06 nm/cycle. After annealing the samples at 700 • C for 6 minutes high temperature phase LiCoO 2 was obtained, as was demonstrated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. A new procedure was proposed to obtain the composition of all three chemical elements in the LiCoO 2 films. Elastic Backscattering Spectroscopy (EBS) measurements turned out to be very convenient and reliable to obtain the quantities of all chemical elements, including lithium. Moreover, the ALD-deposited LiCoO 2 thin film electrodes were electrochemically characterized, revealing good electrochemical performance. To the best of our knowledge this paper provides the first evidence that electrochemically active LiCoO 2 can be deposited by ALD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the past decade, portable electronic devices have become considerably more widespread, complex and powerful, and new challenges have been encountered, especially in the field of medical and autonomous devices. To power these future devices, thin-film, allsolid-state, lithium-ion micro-batteries have been proposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> To facilitate the required energy demand, both a high energy-to-weight and energy-to-volume ratio is essential. Lithium-ion batteries fulfill these demands. As packaging requirements become more dominant at smaller dimensions, one of the remaining challenges is miniaturization of lithium-ion batteries without decreasing the storage capacity. This formed the basis of the integrated batteries concept. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Step conformal deposition of films onto etched structures in silicon is an excellent method to tackle this challenge and to facilitate the integration of these high capacity energy storage devices into microelectronics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been proposed as deposition method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> However, CVD has a limited step-conformal deposition capability in highly structured geometries due to the delicate interplay between kinetics and diffusion. By using atomic layer deposition (ALD) this effect can be counteracted as this deposition method is based on a reaction-limited surface saturation, opening up numerous possibilities for the use of more complex substrate structures such as nanowires. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Industrial scale implementation of ALD has already been proven in micro-electronics and this technique is rapidly penetrating new fields, such as solar cells, catalysis and recently also energy storage devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In the field of battery technology several interesting materials have been prepared which show much promise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> However, work on lithium-containing solid-state electrolytes and electrode materials is still very exploratory. Even though several lithium-containing compounds have recently been prepared by ALD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> no reports of electrochemical investigations are available to date. An overview of Li-containing compounds prepared by ALD is presented in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. This paper demonstrates the electrochemical activity for ALDprepared LiCoO 2 which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first active Li-containing battery material, deposited by ALD, which is electrochemically characterized in detail. Therefore, for reference, also LiCoO 2 CVD processes are included in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><p>Evidently, analyzing the chemical composition of thin films is essential to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the LiCoO 2 . Although it is most uncommon to use backscattering techniques such as Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) for the determination of the Li content in thin films, this has been achieved by making use of non-Rutherford cross sections. The as-obtained results will be verified by Nuclear Reaction Analyzes (NRA). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> This is another novelty within this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Film preparation.-The LiCoO 2 films were deposited using an open-load thermal and remote plasma ALD reactor as described previously for the deposition of Co 3 O 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source that is operated on O 2 is connected to a deposition chamber along with a pump unit through gate valves. The pump unit consists of a rotary and turbo molecular pump, which can reach a base pressure of &lt;10 <ref type="bibr">-5</ref> Torr by overnight pumping. The CoCp 2 and LiO t Bu precursors (both 98%, Strem Chemicals) were heated to 80 • C and 120 • C respectively (Table <ref type="table">II</ref>) and they were bubbled with Ar at a reactor pressure of 0.02 Torr. The substrate was heated to 325 • C, while the reactor walls, Ar lines, and CoCp 2 precursor lines were maintained at a temperature of 105 • C, the LiO t Bu precursor lines were kept at 150 • C to prevent precursor condensation. Si(100) with native oxide and Si(100) with 400 nm thermally grown SiO 2 were used as substrates for materials analyzes. For the electrochemical characterization, Si/TiO 2 /Pt substrates were prepared by ALD as described in Ref. 8 and schematically shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> 8 with thicknesses of 5 and 20 nm for TiO 2 and Pt respectively.</p><p>The remote plasma ALD process for LiCoO 2 consists of the two individual ALD processes for the deposition of Co 3 O 4 and Li 2 CO 3 which are combined in a so-called super-cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Here the previously described remote plasma ALD process for Co 3 O 4 is combined with a novel ALD process, using a lithium precursor reported recently for the deposition of LLT and Li 2 CO 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> In this paper a super-cycle is defined as a combination of A cycles Co 3 O 4 and B cycles Li 2 CO 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), resulting in a dosing ratio of A:B (e.g. 4:1), where B is consistently kept as 1 throughout the paper. x is defined as A/B, e.g. for a dosing ratio of 4:1, x equals 4.

During and after the precursor dosing and plasma exposure, the reaction chamber is purged (3 s and 0.5 s respectively) and evacuated.</p><p>Film analyzes.-The thickness and dielectric function of the films were monitored during the ALD process by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) with a J.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000U (0.75-5.0 eV) ellipsometer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The optical range was extended to 6.5 eV after the deposition process, using ex situ variable angle measurements with a J.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000D ellipsometer. The dielectric function of Co 3 O 4 has been extracted from the SE measurements using an optical model employing a Gauss, a Tauc-Lorentz, and two Lorentz oscillators, to account for the absorption bands. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The dielectric functions of Li 2 CO 3 and LiCoO 2 were parameterized using a mathematical description in the form of B-splines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> This is a method that requires no prior knowledge about the dielectric function of deposited films and enables in situ thickness measurements.</p><p>The microstructure of the LiCoO 2 films was studied using Grazing Incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) with a Philips X'Pert MPD diffractometer equipped with a Cu K α source (1.54 Å radiation). The Raman spectra of the samples were recorded using a (in-via Renishaw) micro Raman scattering setup with a wavelength of 514.5 nm, a maximum power density of 3.2 • 10 5 W/cm 2 and a resolution of 1.6 cm -1 .</p><p>The overall composition of the layers has been analyzed at AccTec BV 15 with backscattering spectrometry using a 2.09 MeV proton beam delivered and a scattering angle of 172 • . Under these circumstances the cross sections of the lighter elements are strongly enhanced with respect to the Rutherford cross sections and strictly spoken the technique should be referred to as Elastic Backscattering (EBS) instead of RBS. The enhancement for the cross sections of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Li, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> C, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> O with respect to the Rutherford values is about 55, 5 and 4 respectively. The main advantage is that all elements can now be determined from one single spectrum. The alpha yield was simultaneously measured from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Li(p,α) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> He nuclear reaction to confirm the Li content with NRA. The Co, O and C concentrations have been confirmed with conventional RBS measurements using 2 MeV He + ions. More details of the EBS analysis will be published in a separate paper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Electrochemical analyzes.-The electrochemical analyzes were performed in three-electrode cylindrical electrochemical cells with an effective surface area of 2 cm 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The cells were made of Teflon with a volume of about 15 ml. The cells were assembled in an argonfilled glove-box. The Si/TiO 2 /Pt/LiCoO 2 electrodes were mounted as working electrodes and back-contacted, and in direct contact with LiCoO 2 , with silver paint to facilitate good electrical conductivity. A Cu plate was used as electrical conductor for the working electrode, while pure lithium foils were used as counter and reference electrodes. 1 molar LiClO 4 dissolved in Ethyl Carbonate (EC)/Diethyl Carbonate (DEC) was used as liquid electrolyte (Puriel, Techno, Semichem Co., Ltd, Korea). The cells were placed in a stainless steel holder that was thermostatically controlled at room temperature. Contaminants in the glove-box (water and oxygen) were monitored and controlled below 1 ppm. Galvanostatic cycling was performed with a M2300 galvanostat (Maccor, Tulsa, USA), applying a current density of 0.5 μAh/cm 2 between 3.0 and 4.1 V. The following definition is adopted throughout the manuscript: charging LiCoO 2 refers to Li-ion extraction (or delithiation) and discharging to Li-ion insertion (or lithiation). Based on the electrode surface area, the layer thickness as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry and the density determined by quantitative EBS measurements (Table <ref type="table">III</ref>), the volumetric and gravimetric capacities were calculated.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>ALD growth.-To investigate the ALD process parameters, the self-limiting behavior of the ALD process was investigated for the CoCp 2 and LiO t Bu precursors using a Co:Li dosing ratio of 1:1 for the super-cycle as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This means that one cycle of Co 3 O 4 was alternated with one cycle of Li 2 CO 3 . The plasma exposure time was fixed at 5 seconds for both precursors. The Li precursor dosing time was varied while the Co dosing time remained constant at 2 s, which is the same dosing time used during the deposition of Co 3 O 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Saturation of the Li precursor occurs after about 2 s as can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>. The same procedure was conducted for the Co precursor while the Li dosing time was kept constant at 2 s. Proper saturation is also observed in the Co case (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>). Note that the growth rates under saturated conditions are slightly different in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>. This can most likely be attributed to the different film thicknesses employed when generating Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>. the growth rate was found the change</p><p>0 1 2 3 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 Growth per cycle (nm) Li precursor dosing time (s) a 0 1 2 3 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 b Growth per cycle (nm) Co precursor dosing time (s) slightly with film thicknesses (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).

This could be due to the high growth rate of pure Li 2 CO 3 as compared to pure Co 3 O 4 , 9,12 but</p></div>

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows that the thickness was almost linearly dependent on the number of ALD cycles at a dosing ratio of Co:Li = 4:1 with an overall growth rate of ∼0.06 nm/cycle. It is not expected that a change in Co:Li dosing ratio will significantly affect the saturation behavior for both precursors in the Co 3 O 4 and Li 2 CO 3 cycles. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows the in situ measured dielectric function ε 2 for photon energies between 1.24 and 6.5 eV of the as-deposited Co 3 O 4 , Li 2 CO 3 and LiCoO 2 . A clear difference is found between the three films. The dielectric function of Co 3 O 4 has been described in an earlier publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Unfortunately, from the literature not much is known about the dielectric functions of Li 2 CO 3 and LiCoO 2 . In order to distinguish between Co 3 O 4 , Li 2 CO 3 and LiCoO 2 the films of the latter two materials have also been investigate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> clearly shows that Li 2 CO 3 hardly contributes to the LiCoO 2 signal and that a typical spectrum for LiCoO 2 is obtained.</p><p>Material properties.-Knowledge of the overall film composition is essential in order to evaluate ALD-deposited LiCoO 2 thin films, especially to properly evaluate the electrochemical results. EBS and NRA are excellent techniques to determine the atomic composition of compounds and can thus be used to reveal the ratio between lithium, cobalt and oxygen in the films (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> These analyzes show that materials prepared with a Co:Li dosing ratio x of 4 and higher have more or less the same atomic ratios (Table <ref type="table">III</ref>). In addition, a Co:Li dosing ratio larger than 4:1 seems to increase the deposition rate of the lithium sub-cycle in the ALD process slightly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>), while the deposition rate during the cobalt sub-cycle is unaffected and continues to increase linearly with x. This effect is not yet fully understood, but limits the ALD process from obtaining the desired Co/Li = 1 material composition for the range investigated. This illustrates the delicate balance that needs to be taken into account when dealing with the ALD-deposition of ternary compounds.  As-deposited samples were investigated by GI-XRD and Raman spectroscopy and subsequently annealed at 700 • C for 6 minutes before being measured again with the same techniques. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> shows that a large diffraction peak becomes visible after annealing at a 2θ angle of 19 • , which has also been reported in the literature for metal organic (MO) CVD deposited LiCoO 2 at various temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> This peak can be assigned to either the (111) reflection of Co 3 O 4 or the (003) reflection of LiCoO 2 . As both cobalt oxide and lithium cobalt oxide can be present in the deposited thin films it is not possible to unambiguously determine the origin of the diffraction peak and the nature of the film from XRD. Therefore Raman spectroscopy has been used to further investigate these films. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> shows that the high temperature (HT) hexagonal phase of LiCoO 2 is observed with two typical phonon modes at 486 and 596 cm -1 which becomes even more defined after annealing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> The Raman spectra reveal no significant fraction of Co 3 O 4 in the films as this would lead to a distinct peak at 693 cm -1 .</p><p>Electrochemical analyzes.-It is well-known that a heat-treatment of about 700 • C is required to obtain the electrochemically active, crystalline, LiCoO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> The annealed LiCoO 2 films were electrochemically characterized in the experimental three-electrode battery set-up using  constant current (dis)charge cycling. The charge transfer reaction of the LiCoO 2 electrode can be represented by LiCoO 2 Li (1-z) CoO 2 + z Li + + z e - (z ≤ 0.5) [1]</p><p>where z ≤ 0.5. Extracting more than 0.5 lithium atoms per formula unit would irreversibly change the crystal structure of LiCoO 2 , making the electrode (partly) electrochemically inactive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref> All electrode films investigated showed electrochemical activity. However, the storage capacity was clearly found to be dependent on the ALD dosing ratio. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9a</ref> shows the (dis)charge behavior of the LiCoO 2 electrode for the Co:Li dosing ratio x of 4 which revealed the highest storage capacity. By taking the derivate of the storage capacity with respect to the electrode potential (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9b</ref>), the plateaus in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9a</ref> are transformed into either broad or sharp peaks dependent on the slope of the voltage curves. A clear charge transfer reaction is now visible at 3.9 V as expected for LiCoO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> Also a 12% capacity loss between the charge and discharge reactions is found (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9a</ref>). A similar effect has been reported before <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref> and this has been attributed to irreversible side reactions (e.g. oxidation of the liquid electrolyte, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref> the formation of the less electrochemically active spinel LiCo 2 O 4 phase 23 or mechanical strain-induced degradation of the LiCoO 2 film, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> but also the (electro)chemical stability of the impurities found in ALD LiCoO 2 with respect to the liquid electrolyte could play a role.</p><p>The electrochemical storage capacity is, however, lower than theoretically expected for LiCoO 2 (155 mAh/g), <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> but remained fairly stable upon cycling as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9c</ref>. Over 60% of the maximum theoretical storage capacity has been obtained with the ALD deposited (x = 4) thin film electrode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9c</ref>). This lower capacity can be explained by the presence of Li 2 CO 3 within the thin film as indicated by the increased oxygen over cobalt (O/Co) and decreased cobalt over lithium (Co/Li) ratios and the presence of carbon (Table <ref type="table">III</ref>). Moreover Table <ref type="table">III</ref> shows an abundance of lithium and oxygen which could also indicate the formation of inactive Li 2 O during the ALD process. These two effects may contribute to the reduced capacity compared to the theoretical maximum. Referring to Table III it is clear that the impurity level of the x = 2 material is significantly higher than the x = 4 material. This is in line with the reduced capacity of the x = 2 material compared to x = 4. It is expected that further process optimization will yield a higher chemical purity and improved storage capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>A remote plasma ALD process for the preparation of LiCoO 2 thin films was developed using the combination of CoCp 2 as cobalt precursor, LiO t Bu as lithium precursor and a O 2 plasma as the oxidant source. To the best of our knowledge this paper provides the first evidence that electrochemically active LiCoO 2 can be deposited by ALD. It was shown that LiCoO 2 films could be deposited by ALD with the Li/Co ratio depending on the Co:Li dosing ratio. Moreover elastic backscattering spectrometry was shown to be an accurate method to analyze the Li-content in this type of films, which simplifies the analysis significantly. After heat-treatment the high temperature phase of LiCoO 2 was obtained as shown by XRD and Raman measurements.</p></div>
