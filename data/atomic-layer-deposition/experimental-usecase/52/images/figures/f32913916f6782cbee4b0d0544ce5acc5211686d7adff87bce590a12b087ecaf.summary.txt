The chart illustrates the relationship between Co/Li dosing ratio and the number of atoms per nm² supercycle for Li NRA, Li RBS, and Co RBS, along with the Co/Li atomic ratio. As the Co/Li dosing ratio increases, the number of atoms per nm² supercycle for Li NRA and Li RBS remains relatively constant, while that for Co RBS increases. The Co/Li atomic ratio also shows an increasing trend.
