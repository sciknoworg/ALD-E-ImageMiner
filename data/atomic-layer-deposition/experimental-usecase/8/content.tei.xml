<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The ALD method relies on alternate pulsing of the precursor gases and vapors onto the substrate surface and subsequent chemisorption or surface reaction of the precursors w1x. The reactor is purged with an inert gas between the precursor pulses. With a proper adjustment of the experimental conditions the process proceeds via saturative steps. Under such conditions the growth is stable and the thickness increase is constant in each deposition cycle. The self-limiting growth mechanism facilitates the growth of conformal thin films with accurate thickness on large areas w2x. The growth of different multilayer structures is also straightforward w3x. These advantages make the ALD method attractive for microelectronics for manufacturing of future generation integrated circuits w4x.</p><p>ALD was originally developed for fabrication of polycrystalline luminescent ZnS:Mn and amorphous Al O insulator films for electroluminescent flat panel 2 3 displays, and the method itself was termed atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) w5x. The early ALE literature dealt with polycrystalline II-VI compounds and amorphous oxide films w6x. Since 1985, epitaxial growth of III-V and *Corresponding author. Tel.: q358-9191-50195; fax: q358-9191-50198.</p><p>E-mail address: markku.leskela@helsinki.fi (M. Leskela).</p><p>¨II-VI compounds gained much interest w7-9x, but no real breakthrough was achieved in this area due to the complicated surface chemistry. Since the mid 1990s, rapidly increasing interest towards ALD has originated from the silicon based microelectronics. This increase is a consequence of the ever decreasing device dimensions and increasing aspect ratios in integrated circuits (IC).</p><p>In addition, the required thickness of the films has, in many cases, decreased to the order of a few nanometers and therefore the main drawback of ALD, the low deposition rate, is becoming less important. The processing temperatures should also be kept low (preferably -400 8C). These requirements further increase the attraction of the ALD method in the IC industry w10x. ALD has recently been described in several reviews focusing on different areas; catalysts w11x, nanotechnology w12x, and electronic and optoelectronic materials w13,14x. In this review the principles of the ALD method are presented emphasizing the importance of precursor and surface chemistry. Based on recent literature, selected ALD processes developed for films used in microelectronics are described as examples and they include deposition of oxide films for dielectrics, and nitride diffusion barriers and metals for metallizations. Plasmaenhanced ALD has recently been introduced to materials applied in silicon based microelectronics and the first papers are reviewed here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Precursor chemistry</head><p>Precursor chemistry plays a key role in ALD. The precursors must of course be volatile and thermally stable but they may be gases, liquids or solids. Precursors must chemisorb on the surface or react rapidly with the surface groups and react aggressively with each other. In that way, it is possible to reach the saturation stage in a short time (less than 1 s) and thereby ensure a reasonable deposition rate. The aggressive reaction requirement is contrary to traditional CVD precursors. The desired ALD reactions should have a large negative DG value, but unfortunately thermodynamic data are available only for a limited number of precursors. It seems that in ALD, not only the properties of a single precursor molecule are important, but the combination of the precursors also matters.</p><p>The number of precursors and reactions used in ALD is high as can be seen from the recent reviews made by the authors w15,16x.</p><p>The two cases: non-metal precursors; and metal precursors are very different and show different features. The non-metal precursors are usually hydrides (H O, H S, NH and AsH ) without problems 2 2 3 3 in volatility and thermal stability. Reactivity at reasonable temperatures (-500 8C) and formation of suitable surface species for the metal precursor to be anchored, are properties of H O and H S as shown in many ALD 2 2 papers, but NH and AsH are examples of precursors 3 3</p><p>with more limited reactivity. In the deposition of oxide films, the importance of surface -OH groups has been reported several times w17,18x.</p><p>Metal halides, especially chlorides, have been widely applied in ALD for deposition of oxide, sulfide and nitride films w16x. Most of the halides are solids, but in ALD the solid precursors are not a problem because it is just crucial that the precursor dose is large enough to saturate the surface, but the flux must not necessarily be constant or homogeneous. The other important group of compounds is metal alkyls. In many cases (Al, Zn), the alkyl compounds behave almost ideally in making oxide and sulfide films, but in some cases (Ga, In) the results have not been very promising due to the complex and unfavorable surface chemistry. Metal alkoxides form the third important group of precursors and they have been successfully employed in several oxide processes w16x. Electropositive metals (alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals) form a challenge for chemical thin film depositions because they do not have many volatile compounds w19x. b-Diketonates are the most studied compounds of these metals and good results have been obtained in growth of alkaline earth sulfide films w20x, but the growth of oxide films using water as oxygen source does not work. b-Diketonates can be used as precursors in deposition of, for example, rare earth oxide but then ozone has been employed as an oxygen source w21,22x. The resulting films have been polycrystalline and contained only small amounts of carbon. Recently, cyclopentadienyl compounds were introduced as ALD precursors and they have been used in deposition of both alkaline earth titanate and sulfide films w23,24x. The commercial availability of new metalorganic precursors is often limited. The scale-up of precursor syntheses and the development of new precursors are challenges for the further progress of ALD in industrial scale.</p><p>During the last 2 years, a few new precursors have been introduced to ALD and reaction mechanistic studies have been carried out for several older precursors.</p><p>Although halides have been known for a long time as good ALD precursors, not much attention has earlier been given to fluorides, bromides and iodides. Recently, fluorides and iodides have gained more attention, but also new chloride precursors have been taken into use. BCl is a new precursor, which has been introduced 3 very recently. BCl reacts with ammonia and forms BN 3 film in ALD fashion w25x. Shimogaki et al. w26x reported about the first chloride adduct precursor in their flow modulation CVD process. They used tantalum chloride thioether adduct and ammonia in deposition of TaN films. The important benefit of this adduct is that, unlike TaCl itself, it is a liquid. Tungsten hexafluoride has 5 been examined as a precursor for tungsten metal and tungsten nitride films. With smart chemistry WF can 6 be transformed to W with disilane w27x. The particular features of the WF -Si H process are: it involves an 6 2 6</p><p>exchange reaction during both reaction steps; the growth rate is high, 2.5 Aycycle; and the process window is ẘide, 150-330 8C. The films were, however, amorphous and rather resistive. WF is also a suitable precursor in 6 combination with ammonia for nitride films w28,29x. The stoichiometry of the films may vary but the formation of polycrystalline W N has been reported. Vol-2 atile, in situ prepared tungsten oxofluorides are precursors for tungsten oxide, WO w30x. Polycrystalline 3 films can be grown even at 200 8C. WF could not be 6 used as a precursor for oxide films because of etching effects.</p><p>The use of iodides as metal precursor has been studied in deposition of titanium nitride w31x, and oxides of titanium w32,33x, zirconium w34,35x and tantalum w36x. The oxide formation reaction is enhanced if H O is 2 2 used instead of water. The reaction is self-limiting at lower temperatures, but at higher temperatures metal iodides slightly decompose. Reaction mechanism studies show that in the case of TiO , the situation is compli-2 cated because of the structural change (anatase-rutile) of the oxide, which changes the growth mechanism w33x. The TiI -H O process has even facilitated epitaxial above 350 8C, which is 50 8C higher than in the TaCl -5 H O process w36x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>A new ALD precursor, triphenyl compound, has been introduced for bismuth w38x. Bismuth oxide cannot be grown from triphenyl bismuth and H O , but a ternary 2 2 Bi-Ti-O could be deposited. In the as-deposited films, bismuth may partially be metallic, and the ternary oxide phase is formed only upon annealing in air at 500 8C. Further annealing at 700 8C resulted in a crystalline dielectric Bi Ti O phase, but it was not possible to 2 2 7 obtain bismuth titanates with higher bismuth content. A few new alkoxide precursors have been studied for the deposition of zirconium oxide films, namely tetra-tertbutoxide w39x, tetrakis-dimethylaminoethoxide (DMAE), and mixed ligand complexes of DMAE with isopropoxide and tert-butoxide w40x. Characteristic for all these precursors is that they already decompose significantly at 240 8C. Interestingly, especially with aminoethoxides, the decomposition appears to be water assisted. However, uniform films could be grown. Vanadium oxide is a new ALD material grown for electrochemical battery purpose w41x. The precursors were vanadyl tri-isopropoxide wVO(O Pr) x and water. The</p><p>i 3</p><p>process was self-limiting up to 180 8C above which the self-decomposition started to play a role.</p><p>No effective ALD processes have been found so far for silicon dioxide. In all reports long pulse times have been required to saturate the reactions. An interesting report was recently given by <ref type="bibr">Gordon et al. w42x</ref> where they present the deposition of SiO from N,N9-di-tert-2 butyl-1,3-diaza-2-silacyclopent-4-en-2-ylidene and oxygen at 200 8C. They flash evaporated the precursor solution and a deposition rate of 0.05 nmycycle was obtained throughout the length (30 cm) of the deposition zone.</p><p>Metal alkyl amides have been extensively studied as CVD precursors for nitride thin films. Recently they have also been introduced to ALD w43x. Tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium (or tetrakis(ethylmethylamido)titanium)-ammonia processes have shown to be self-limiting at 170-210 8C when high ammonia doses and long exposure times were employed. The deposition rate was high-twice to that of the monolayer growth in the w111x direction of TiN. When silane is added to the process, Ti-Si-N films can be grown and the composition can be varied up to a Si content of 23 at.% by controlling the number of silane pulses w44x. Silane blocks the growth and accordingly the growth rate decreases along the increasing silicon content of the films. Ti-Si-N films showed excellent conformality and barrier properties against Cu diffusion, but are apparently resistive w43x. Tantalum nitride film has been deposited from tert-butylimidotris(diethylamido)tantalum. Hydrogen radicals were used to reduce this single source precursor w45x. The films were Ta rich in composition and contained approximately 15 at.% of carbon impurity. A new aluminum precursor, dimethyl(aluminum hydride)-ethylenepiperidine has been employed in ALD deposition of AlN films. In that study, the interfaces in TiNyAlN multilayers were of interest w46x. Also, a great variety of oxides can potentially be deposited from the alkyl amides w42x.</p><p>Recent ALD literature contains a few reports on new processes where b-diketonates have been employed in deposition of oxide films. Mg(thd) (thds2,2,6,6-tetra-2 methyl-3,5-heptanedione) can be combined with hydrogen peroxide, and MgO film is formed at 325-425 8C with a growth rate of 0.10-0.14 Aycycle w47x. Indium åcetylacetonate serves as a precursor in the ALD growth of indium sulfide In S . An amorphous film was depos-2 3 ited at 160 8C with a growth rate of 0.8 Aycycle and it ẘas aimed for CuInSe solar cells as a buffer layer w48x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>In ALD oxide processes, water has most often been the oxygen source. As mentioned above, ozone has been used when a highly reactive oxidizing agent is needed w21,22x. Ozone is also an applicable precursor to be combined with trimethyl aluminum in deposition of Al O . The authors claim that excellent electrical prop-2 3 erties can be achieved with this OH-free process w49x. However, especially for gate oxide applications, the strongly oxidizing character of O is of major concern 3 as it easily creates too thick SiO interfacial layers. A 2 few recent reports exist where molecular oxygen has been used as the oxygen precursor. TiO has been grown 2 from titanium iodide and oxygen at 200-350 8C w50x, and ZrO from tert-butoxide and oxygen at 300-400 8C 2 w51x. It seems that the metal precursor should be slightly thermally unstable and then oxygen is reactive enough for the oxide formation reaction at these relatively low temperatures. <ref type="bibr">Schuisky et al. w50x</ref> were able also with the TiI qO process to deposit epitaxial rutile on 4 2 sapphire (012) and anatase on MgO (001) surfaces. The use of oxygen plasma is a new trend in ALD deposition of oxide films.</p><p>Water or hydrogen peroxide are not always desired oxygen sources because they may be too oxidative or reactive and therefore, a water-free process based on alkoxides has been developed w4x. The metal alkoxide serves as both metal and oxygen source while the other metal compound, typically a metal chloride, acts as the other metal source:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ž . bM OR qaM9X ™M M9 O qabRX a b a b a b</formula><p>Depending on whether M and M9 are similar or different, binary or mixed oxides are obtained. The major benefit of not using separate oxygen precursors is the less susceptible oxidation of the substrate surfaces. This is very important when thin oxide layers are to be deposited directly on silicon without creating an interfacial silicon oxide layer. deposition of transition metal nitride films, the development trends from the precursor chemistry point of view are: finding more reactive nitrogen precursors to replace ammonia; and finding reducing agents to reduce the metal ion to the formal oxidation state of q III. These trends will be addressed in Section 5. One way to overcome the problems with nitrogen precursors and reducing agents is the use of plasma-assisted ALD (see Section 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Reaction mechanisms</head><p>The ALD reactors used in industrial scale and often in laboratories, are of a flow-type which makes fast pulsing and purging possible. In the flow-type reactors the pressures are 1-10 mbar which limits the selection of possible in situ characterization methods. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) has successfully been used to examine several ALD oxide processes w52,53x. Recently, a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS)-ALD reactor set-up has been presented w54,55x, and also a QMS-QCM-ALD combination has been used w56x. Optical techniques form another group of methods, which have been used to characterize surface processes in flow type ALD reactors w16x. Both surface photo absorption (SPA) and reflectance difference spectroscopy have been employed. A variation from the SPA technique is termed incremental dielectric reflection (IDR) method and it has been used in analysis of ALD growth of TiO w57x. It is worth mentioning that the 2 limitation of optical characterization methods is the lack of chemical information.</p><p>The in situ measurements allow the investigation of reaction mechanisms in ALD reaction steps. The QCM signal shows the relative weight of the adsorbed species, while the QMS gives information on the gaseous species releasing in the surface reaction. The measurements are complementary and the results agree w56x. The in situ studies have verified the importance of surface groups in ALD growth. The measurements show, for example in the case of oxide films, how many ligands are released when the metal precursor reacts with the surface -OH groups, i.e. the mechanism of the adsorption step. During the last 2 years several oxide processes involving water as an oxygen source have been studied by QCM. The metal precursors in these studies have been: titanium chloride w58,59x; titanium iodide w32x; titanium ethoxide w60x; titanium isopropoxide w61x; trimethyl aluminum w55,62x; vanadyl isopropoxide w48x; tantalum iodide w36x; and diethyl zinc w63x. QMS or QMS-QCM combinations have been used in studies of reactions of water with titanium chloride w64x, titanium isopropoxide w65x, and titanium, niobium and tantalum ethoxides w66x. In situ studies can also give useful information on ternary systems. The example on SrTiO shows that the adsorp-3 tion of titanium isopropoxide on SrO is different than the adsorption of strontium bis(tri-isopropylcyclopentadienyl) on TiO , and more strikingly the growth of SrO 2 on SrO is very different than that on TiO w67x. The 2 first QMS study on nitride process regarding deposition of TiN and Ti(Al)N, has also been carried out w68x.</p><p>In situ studies on different titanium precursors in ALD of TiO at 250 8C revealed an interesting and 2 quite unexpected difference in reaction mechanisms; while TiCl lost one and Ti(O Pr) two ligands in i 4 4 reactions with surface hydroxyl groups when arriving on the surface, less than 10% of the ligands in Ti(OEt) were released at this stage. This suggests that 4 Ti(OEt) adsorbs molecularly rather than undergoing 4 exchange reactions with surface hydroxyl groups. On the other hand, as the other two cases indicate, there clearly should be hydroxyl groups on the TiO surface 2 at this temperature for Ti(OEt) to react with. Therefore, 4 another explanation for the observed difference is an adsorption of ethanol formed during the Ti(OEt) pulse 4 so that it becomes released from the surface only when replaced by water during the next pulse. Separate experiments verified the ethanol adsorption on TiO under 2 these conditions. Above 250 8C, the behavior of TiCl 4 resembled that of Ti(OEt) , whereas Ti(O Pr) started i 4 4</p><p>to decompose. The decomposition of Ti(OEt) com-4 menced beyond 300 8C.</p><p>Besides examining the form in which the precursor is adsorbed on the surface, the in situ studies can also give information on several other aspects, like reaction byproduct re-adsorption and possible etching processes. The latter is important especially when growing niobium or tantalum oxide from pentachlorides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Oxide films</head><p>The recent ALD oxide studies have often dealt with growth mechanism investigations, but also the structural properties of the films have been of interest w32,37,38,69,70x. One important material type of ALD oxides is nanolaminates which consist of alternating layers of two or more insulator materials, so that each separate layer has a thickness in a range of 1-20 nm. The preparation of nanolaminates with accurately varying composition depth profiles is straightforward in ALD. In nanolaminates the advantageous properties of each component can be retained, for example, in insulators: high permittivity; low leakage current density; and high charge storage capacity w16x. Recently, the effects of niobium oxide layers to tantalum oxide and aluminum oxide have been studied w71,72x. It was shown, for example, that the permittivity of Al O can 2 3 be increased with Nb O addition without considerable 2 5 loss in resistivity. The films containing 37 cation% niobium showed similar leakage currents as aluminum oxide films, but upon further increase in Nb content the leakage currents increased markedly.</p><p>ALD oxide films find industrial applications as dielectrics in electroluminescent thin film displays, but in the future gate oxides for MOSFET transistors will also perhaps be processed by ALD. The new gate oxides which will replace SiO are very thin, they must be 2 deposited on bare silicon surface, the interface between silicon and the oxide should be tailored, and the gate oxide may also be a multilayer structure. All these requirements are demanding but not impossible for ALD. The gate oxides must be stable on silicon and the materials under investigation are Al, Zr, Hf and rare earth oxides. As mentioned above, all these oxide materials have been deposited by ALD w16x. The focus in the investigations has recently been in structural and electrical characterization of thin oxide films on silicon.</p><p>High resolution depth-profiling of ultrathin Al O films 2 3 on Si revealed stoichiometric composition and abrupt interface, and showed that ALD Al O is a possible gate 2 3 dielectric material for MOS devices with equivalent electrical thickness in the sub 2 nm range w73x. The robustness of the ultrathin Al O films on Si was studied 2 3 by high-temperature vacuum annealing at 900 8C and oxidation at 600 8C. The results showed that the films were stable in vacuum, but formation of interfacial SiO took place during oxidation w74x. The MOSFET 2 results on ALD Al O (t s13 A) for 0.08 mm gate 2 3 eq length transistors with poly-Si gates showed a reduction in leakage current of two orders of magnitude compared to SiO having the same t -value w75x. Also, the first 2 e q results on electrical properties of stacked ALD oxide layers (aluminum or zirconium) on SiO have been 2 promising w76,77x. In a very recent study, Gusev et al. w78x found that 1.5-10-nm-thick ALD Zr, Hf, Y and Al oxides on silicon all exhibited good interface quality, and gate leakage much lower than conventional SiO of 2 the same equivalent electrical thickness. Earlier, they had shown that a highly uniform layer of ZrO can be 2 deposited as thin as 2 nm on top of an SiO layer w79x. 2 The SiO layer was needed, although it limits the 2 minimum achievable t -value, because uniform zircoeq nium oxide is difficult to grow on Si-H terminated surface with the chloride process. In fact, getting a good start for the growth of any oxide on Si-H surface is clearly an important issue for gate oxide applications of ALD. Perkins et al. w80x have shown that ALD processing of polycrystalline ZrO (5 nm) on silicon produces 2 an amorphous layer (1.5 nm), which has higher dielectric constant than SiO . The whole structure has t s13 2 e q</p><p>A and shows leakage value of 10 Aycm at a bias of y5 2 ẙ1 V.</p><p>The nanolaminate concept has so far been slightly problematic in gate oxide application since the permittivity of the oxide films decreases significantly with the film thickness. Equivalent thicknesses of approximately 3 nm have been achieved in Ta-Hf, Ta-Zr and Zr-Hf oxide nanolaminates w81x. In another study Ta, Ta-Nb-O, Zr-Al-O, and Zr-Al-Nb-O oxide and nanolaminates were examined w82x. When Ta O was deposited 2 5 on silicon, an 8-A-thick SiO layer was formed, but the 2 capacitance equivalent oxide thickness of Ta O was 2 5 1.2-1.5 nm. The leakage current density in those films was approximately 5=10</p><p>Aycm at 1 MVycm. In y4 2</p><p>Zr-Al-O films, the relatively high permittivity of ZrO was combined with high resistivity of Al O , and 2 2 3 films with t s2-2.5 nm and low leakage could be eq deposited. When niobium was added to Zr-Al-O, t eq could be lowered to 1.8-2.0 nm w82x.</p><p>Besling et al. w83x achieved better results with ZrO yAl O nanolam-2 2 3 inates; t was 1.1 nm and leakage current densitys eq 10 Aycm at 1 V. y7 2</p><p>The other concern in deposition of gate oxides is that silicon should not oxidize during the deposition process. One possibility to avoid that is not to use any strongly oxidizing precursor. Metal alkoxides have successfully been used as oxygen source materials in ALD deposition and no oxidation of silicon was observed w4x. The formation of metal silicates when Si(OEt) or 4 Si(OBu) was used as alkoxide was an important result 4 since silicates may be useful gate dielectric materials too. The exchange reactions between metal halides and alkoxides have further been studied with tantalum oxide and titaniumyzirconium oxide w84,85x. The growth proceeds without water, but water can be added as a supplementary oxygen source. The growth rate is dependent on temperature and the growth rate can be increased by introducing the precursors simultaneously (CVD mode) into the reactor. A further extension of this chemistry is the use of metal alkyl amides like Hf(NR ) and ( BuO) SiOH w42x.</p><p>t 2 4 3</p><p>In the future, DRAM capacitors high-k materials are needed, Ba Sr TiO being the most extensively stud-1yx x 3 ied material. Recently, ALD processes have been developed for barium and strontium titanates w16,86x using Sr and Ba cyclopentadienyl compounds as precursors, together with titanium iospropoxide and water. Excellent conformality was achieved in the ALD STO films and the films were crystalline as-deposited at 325 8C w16x. Permittivity values decrease along the decreasing film thickness, but a value of 100 has been obtained in a 50nm-thick film. Further works have focused on integration of STO and BTO films with platinum electrodes w87x. If alkaline earth b-diketonates are used as precursors, the oxygen source must be ozone and deposition post-annealing in air is needed to achieve crystalline titanate phase w88x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Nitride films</head><p>Transition metal nitride films are used in ICs as barriers preventing interdiffusion and reactions between metals and silicon or insulators. The barrier films in metallization have strict demands: they should be pure; conductive; conformal; thin; have good adhesion towards metals and insulators; and the processing temperature should not exceed 400 8C. The conformality requirement is especially demanding since the aspect ratios of trenches and vias have increased. The requirements concerning process technique can be fulfilled by ALD. The materials studied for this purpose are TiN, TaN and Ta metal. Several ALD nitride processes have been developed and in most of them, ammonia is used as a nitrogen source w15,16x. The problem usually is how to get the transition metal reduced to the formal q III state needed; especially for TaN, a strong reducing agent is needed, otherwise a dielectric Ta N phase is 3 5 obtained w89x.</p><p>The majority of the ALD transition metal nitride processes have been based on metal chlorides and ammonia. Best results have been obtained with metallic zinc as an additional reducing agent w89,90x. Because zinc-containing processes are not acceptable in semiconductor applications, new processes are sought. With titanium iodide, a well conducting nitride film can be deposited without zinc w31x. Studies to find new reducers or more effective nitrogen precursors in combination with metal halides are in progress. As examples, the use of trimethylaluminum (TMA) as a reducing agent w91x and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine as a nitrogen precursor w92x can be mentioned. Low TMA doses clearly assist the formation of nitride films. Dimethylhydrazine reduces Ti, Nb and Mo chlorides and the corresponding lowresistivity nitride films are formed at 400 8C and, in the case of TiN, even at 250-400 8C w92x. However, TaCl 5 cannot be reduced by dimethylhydrazine.</p><p>The growth rate in the chloride-ammonia processes has been low, typically 0.2 Aycycle. It is not known ẘhether this is due to a small number of reactive -NH groups left on the surface after the NH pulse, or</p><p>x 3 due to an adsorption site blocking by re-adsorbed reaction byproduct HCl. Elers et al. w93x were, however, able to almost double the growth rate by in situ reducing titanium chloride with metallic titanium. TiCl species 3 formed seemed to be able to utilize the active surface site more effectively than TiCl . The WF -NH process 4 6 3 mentioned above has resulted in a remarkably higher growth rate of 2.55 Aycycle w28x. The TiN films made by chloride-ammonia processes have shown 100% conformance w2,93x and good barrier properties up to 650 8C w94x. Barrier characteristics of 10-and 20-nm-thick ALD TiN films deposited at 350 and 400 8C were examined by high frequency capacitanceyvoltage measurements on MOS capacitors (Cu gate, TiN, SiO 2 dielectric and TaN passivation). The capacitors were stressed at 2 MVycm at 200 and 300 8C for 4 h. A rapid initial flatband shift took place but stressing for longer times did not cause any further shift indicating no significant Cu diffusion into SiO w95x. The biased 2 temperature stress tests of 3 nm TiN films deposited on 200-mm wafers have shown excellent leakage properties after stressing up to 2 MVycm at 200 8C for 12 days w96x.</p><p>Transition metal nitride films can be deposited from alkyl amides and ammonia with high growth rate at low temperatures w42,43x, but the alkyl amides are also quite prone to self-decomposition. TiN films deposited by these reactions have been amorphous and contained some carbon (4 at.%) and hydrogen (6 at.%) impurities w97x. The films have shown excellent conformality and negligible interdiffusion of Cu andyor Si at temperatures lower than 600 8C, but 650 8C triggered the diffusion w98x. Silicon containing films have shown better barrier properties; for example in a CuyTi Si N ySiO y 0.32 0.18 0.50 2</p><p>Si structure, no interdiffusion was detected after annealing at 800 8C for 60 min in H (10%)-Ar(90%) w43x.</p><p>2</p><p>The films suffered from high resistivities, however.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Metal films and plasma-ALD</head><p>A copper ALD process would offer an interesting alternative for IC metallizations. Cu films have been deposited by ALD using hydrogen as a reducing agent for CuCl and Cu(thd) w99x. Both processes seem to be 2 substrate material-dependent, indicating that the substrate (Pt and Pd) actively participates or catalyzes the growth reaction. CuCl and also MoCl can also be 5 reduced to metal by zinc vapor w100,101x. The processes suffer, however, from a reversible dissolution-outdiffusion of zinc into the Cu and Mo films. The well-known solution (electroless deposition) chemistry for copper deposition where the reduction is carried out by organic compounds (formaldehyde, alcohols) has successfully been employed in ALD w102x. The Cu precursor used was 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetonate hydrate and low-resistivity (1.78-4.25 mV) films were deposited at 300 8C. Other thermal ALD metal processes studied so far involve tungsten and nickel. In deposition of tungsten, the WF -Si H -process was employed w27x. Nick-6 2 6</p><p>el deposition involves a two-step process where first NiO is grown from Ni(acac) and ozone and then the 2 oxide is converted to metal upon annealing in hydrogen atmosphere at 260 8C w103x.</p><p>In deposition of nitride and metal films thermal energy is not necessarily enough to activate the reactions. Therefore, plasma enhanced growth has also been introduced to ALD. Thin films of inert refractory materials are used in semiconductor interconnect applications as diffusion barrier, seed and adhesion layers. Ta and Tiy TiN films are typical examples of these. Rossnagel et al. w104x deposited 100% conformal Ta and Ti films at 25-400 8C using a plasma enhanced ALD process, where TaCl and TiCl were reduced by atomic hydrogen 5 4 generated upstream with an inductively coupled RF plasma discharge. Chlorine residues were below 3 at.% and the films deposited below 250 8C were detailed studies of Ti films with QCM system and several different substrate materials have revealed that the growth process is independent of TiCl exposure 4 above 5000 L, and the growth is also saturated with increasing hydrogen plasma power and atomic hydrogen exposure time w105x.</p><p>Atomic hydrogen has also facilitated the epitaxial growth of silicon at 550-610 8C from dichlorosilane both on silicon (100) and (111) surfaces w106,107x. The ideal 1 MLycycle growth can be achieved only when hydrogen pressure is optimized.</p><p>Plasma assistance has also been used in ALD growth of nitride and oxide films. Tetrabutylimidotris(diethylamido)tantalum has been reduced to TaN by hydrogen radicals produced by capacitively coupled RF plasma source w46x. The use of nitrogen radicals is also possible w108x. High-quality aluminum oxide films have been deposited by plasma enhanced ALD. After the aluminum precursor (dimethylethylamine alane) pulse, the reactor was pumped down and H plasma was (CH )x }, zirconium oxide film from t-butoxide and 3 2 aluminum oxide from TMA w110,111x. For example, the growth rate could be increased by 50-100% by using the O plasma.</p><p>2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The ALD method has already shown its versatility in industrial use for deposition of dielectric and luminescent films for electroluminescent flat panel displays. The big challenge to ALD is to gain an established position in microelectronics. It has great potential because of the accurate thickness control in deposition of very thin films and 100% conformality. The first processes suggested for ALD in microelectronics are TiN barriers and gate oxides. The use of plasma activation will expand the ALD thin film materials selection. Because of the promising results obtained with plasma-ALD, it will surely increase in use in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>at low temperature (-400 8C) on single crystal sapphire and MgO substrates w37x.
