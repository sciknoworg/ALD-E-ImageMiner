The scatter plots display the performance metrics of solar cells under different conditions of oxygen and argon exposure times. The metrics include short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (Î·). Each condition shows variability in these metrics, with some conditions yielding higher values than others.
