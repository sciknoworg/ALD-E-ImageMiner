To solve these problems, ALD with metal- organic precursors is suggested. However, the diffusion barrier layers deposited with the metal- organic ALD (MOALD) method showed relatively high carbon impurity incorporation. Also, the process window of MOALD is reduced due to the limited choice of precursors and/or reactants.10)"
