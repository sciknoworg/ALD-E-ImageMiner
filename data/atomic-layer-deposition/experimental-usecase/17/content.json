        "text": "Gallium oxide  $(\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3})$  thin films were deposited on silicon (100) and sapphire (001) substrates using the plasma- enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technique with an alternating supply of reactant source,  $[(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{GaNH}_2]_3$ , and oxygen plasma. The thin films were annealed at different temperatures (500, 700, and  $900^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , respectively) in a rapid thermal annealing system for  $1\\mathrm{min}$ . It was found that  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  thin films deposited by PEALD showed excellent step coverage characteristics. X- ray diffraction measurements showed that the as- deposited thin film was amorphous. However, the thin films annealed at temperatures higher than  $700^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  showed a (400) orientation of the monoclinic structure. An atomic force microscope was used to investigate the surface morphologies of the thin films. The thin films showed very smooth surfaces; the roughness of the as- deposited thin film was about  $4\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . With increasing annealing temperature, the thin film became rougher compared with that annealed at lower temperatures. A double- beam spectrophotometer was used to measure the transmittances of the thin films on the sapphire substrates. The thin films showed a very high transmittance (nearly  $100\\%$ ). The band- gap energies of the thin films were determined by a linear fit of the transmittance spectra and were calculated to be between 5.0 and  $5.24\\mathrm{eV}$ . The electrical properties of thin films of Pt/film/Si structure were also investigated. It was found that, with increasing annealing temperature, the insulating characteristics of the  $\\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$  thin films were significantly improved. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to derive the refractive indices and the thicknesses of the thin films. The refractive indices of the thin films showed normal dispersion behavior. The refractive indices of the thin films annealed at low temperatures were smaller than those annealed at high temperatures. © 2005 American Institute of Physics. [DOI: 10.1063/1.1980535]",

        "text": "Since the thickness of thin films is scaled down to nanometer scale for industrial technologies, thin- film deposition methods for precisely controlled thickness, composition, conformal step coverage, good uniformity, and high throughput are highly desirable. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been confirmed to be a very successful method in meeting such requirements. Due to the inherent atomic- level control and self- saturation chemistry, films deposited by ALD are highly conformal and uniform. Moreover, a lower deposition temperature is also required because interlayer diffusion could destroy the properties of nano scale devices. The introduction of plasma during deposition in the ALD system makes the low- temperature deposition of high- quality thin films possible. The chemical composition of a thin film deposited by ALD has been proved to be uniform in a multicomponent system.3,4 Furthermore, since plasma introduction into the ALD process, in comparison with conventional ALD film, can enlarge the process window of ALD in the lower temperature direction through the enhancement of the chemical reaction, plasma- enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) has recently received much attention.",
