PVD describes a variety of techniques that are based on the condensation of a vaporized form of the film material on the surface to be coated, the substrate. This vaporized form of the material is obtained from a target material by purely physical processes, such as thermal or laser- induced evaporation or sputtering by energetic ion bombardment. The method of CVD, on the other hand, involves chemical reactions. These chemical reactions take place by volatile precursor molecules that decompose at the surface leaving a thin film and volatile byproducts. The chemical reactions are thermally driven, most frequently by heating the substrate. The chemical reactions can also be enhanced by reactive species created in the gas phase, e.g., in plasma- enhanced CVD."

With the advent of three- dimensional transistors in the 22- nm node and beyond, an excellent conformality over the semiconductor fins is also required (Figure 27.2(c)). A high conformality is also vital for many other emerging nanoscale devices, e.g., those involving thin films deposited on nanomaterials such as nanowires (Figure 27.2(d)), nanotubes, and nanoparticles. These nanoscale devices have applications in electronics, sensing, and energy technologies.

Also, some particular cases will be considered to show how ALD manifests itself in practice. It is not within the scope of this chapter to give an in- depth and comprehensive overview of the method, the materials deposited by ALD, and the results obtained with respect to its rapidly growing number of applications. Such information can be found elsewhere [1- 4]. In the next section, the relationship between ALD and epitaxy will be treated briefly, addressing the historical development of the technique from atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) to atomic layer deposition (ALD)."

The first experiments were carried out with elemental source materials such as zinc and sulfur. The method was called atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), as the prime interest was to deposit films of crystalline and polycrystalline materials one atomic layer at a time. However, the method was also used to deposit amorphous dielectric thin films, such as "

During the 1980s, the research efforts on ALE strongly increased when there was interest in fabricating elemental semiconductors, single- crystal III- V and II- VI semiconductors, and ordered heterostructures by ALE. Organometallic compounds such as metal alkyls were used as precursors. Although good results were reported for epitaxial growth, the overall success of ALD for crystalline materials was limited due to the complicated surface chemistry and because ALE did not bring obvious benefits over the traditional molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal- organic vapor- phase epitaxy (MOVPE) methods. As a consequence, the activities in this area of ALE diminished in the mid- 1990s. However, from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, interest in the method by the silicon- based microelectronics industry began to increase [4,6]. Also at that time, the term atomic layer deposition (ALD) was coined, a name which was more appropriate considering the fact that the interest in amorphous films had strongly increased. This increase was most prominent in highly insulating oxide films to be used as low- leakage high- "

Ruled by the trend of miniaturization in electronic devices, these applications have been the main driving force for the development of ALD processes and equipment. These applications were furthermore the first main commercial applications of ALD besides the production of electroluminescent film display devices and thin- film magnetic heads in hard drives. In the last decade, many more potential applications of ALD have been identified as the need for precise growth control has become widespread (as has been addressed in the previous section). The library of materials possible by ALD, including metal oxides, nitrides, carbides, chalcogenides, metals, etc., has significantly expanded over the last years, as addressed later in this chapter (Section 27.4).

In each cycle, a submonolayer of material is deposited. As illustrated in Figure 27.3, a typical cycle consists of four steps: (1) a precursor dosing step, where a precursor is typically an inorganic coordination compound, i.e., a metal center surrounded by chemical functional groups called ligands; (2) a purge and/or pump step; (3) a co- reactant step, typically involving a small molecule; and (4) a purge and/or pump step. The precursor, and in many cases also the co- reactant, bring elements to the surface that lead to film growth. For the precursor, the element to be deposited is in many cases the metal center, while for the reactant, it is typically a nonmetal such as O, N, S, etc. For ALD, it is vital that the precursor and co- reactants react with the surface in a self- limiting way. This means that the precursor molecules and co- reactant species react with surface sites and/or surface chemical groups as long as these are present or accessible; hence the surface reactions eventually saturate and stop. The precursor molecules and co- reactants react neither with themselves nor with the surface groups that they create. In the purge and/or pump steps, the gaseous reaction products that may be generated during the surface reactions, as well as any excess precursor or co- reactant molecules, are removed from the ALD reactor. This is necessary to avoid reactions between precursor and co- reactant molecules directly in the gas phase or on the surface, as this could lead to an undesired CVD component."

The exposures in the first half-cycle (precursor) and second half-cycle (co-reactant) are self-limiting such that the process stops when all available surface sites are occupied. The two half-cycles are separated by purge steps. The half-cycles are repeated in an ABAB fashion to build the film up to the target thickness. The lower panels show the resulting coverage, or growth per cycle, as a function of exposure or time for that particular step. For sufficient exposure, saturated growth is obtained, while insufficient exposure results in incomplete saturation.

Outside the temperature window, several chemical and physical processes can disrupt the ALD behavior. At low temperatures, some precursors and co- reactants can condense on the surface, leading to an increase in GPC. Alternatively, the reactivity of the molecules with the surface sites can be too low because of limited thermal energy at low temperatures, which prevents saturation of the reaction and leads to a decrease in growth. At high temperatures, the precursors or co- reactants can decompose, leading to a CVD component and an increase in growth. Furthermore, the film itself or the reactive surface groups involved may desorb or etch above a certain temperature, leading to a decrease in growth."

The magnified areas show the film coverage of a three-dimensional feature in the substrate. Surface-controlled processes afford a coverage with constant thickness throughout the structure (a), while flux-controlled processes result in a thickness that depends on the line-of-sight access to the source (b). Uniformity has to be carefully engineered for flux-controlled processes to achieve an equal flux of source species over the substrate surface. For surface-controlled growth, the requirement is simply that sufficient flux should reach each area."

The magnified areas in the bottom half of Figure 27.5 indicate the coverage of a three- dimensional structure (conformality). When the flux of source species is sufficient, a perfect coverage is obtained for ideal ALD growth (Figure 27.5(a)). A high conformality indicates an equal thickness throughout a three- dimensional structure, while a low conformality indicates a varying thickness, which is typically seen with flux- controlled growth (Figure 27.5(b)). Reactor engineering can improve the uniformity for flux- controlled growth, but cannot typically improve the conformality."

Figure 27.6 shows a comparison between various process schemes. The process can consist of more than two half- cycles in what is called a multistep process (sometimes referred to as an ABC ALD cycle), and ALD cycles for a certain material can be alternated with cycles for other materials in what is called a supercycle. In a multistep process (Figure 27.6(b)) additional steps can be used to change the process to widen the temperature window or achieve different material properties. Supercycles (Figure 27.6(c)) can be used to grow alloy, doped or multilayer films of specific elemental mixtures. An ALD cycle for the first process is run "

Moreover, the selection of elements that have been successfully incorporated into ALD films is ever increasing, and those reported to date are summarized in Figure 27.7. The periodic table shows that a significant number of main- group elements, transition metals, and lanthanides have been reported in films deposited by ALD, either as the principal metal (blue squares) or as the nonmetal component of binary compounds (gray squares). In principle, ALD is best suited for depositing multicomponent materials (such as binary, tertiary, and quaternary) because of its stepwise approach. Indeed, binary compounds with a metal or nonmetal component do make up the majority of these materials, such as metal oxides, nitrides, carbides, chalcogenides, and pnictides. In general, ALD materials are amorphous or, in some cases, polycrystalline. The most common materials deposited using ALD are metal oxides, mainly as a result of the thermodynamic stability of the M- O bond. However, with advanced ALD process schemes such those based on supercycles, many tertiary and quaternary compounds or alloys are also well- known, such as "

Examples of typical inorganic complexes used as precursors are shown in Figure 27.8. The ligands are essentially what make the metal center volatile and they play a key role in determining the characteristics of the precursor. In general, such metal sources should ideally have the following attributes specifically for ALD."

Without this feature, precursors and co-reactions would not undergo surface chemical reactions and ALD would not occur.- The precursor must not react with itself or with its surface-adsorbed species.- The precursor should have a sufficiently high decomposition temperature. If decomposition occurs, the self-limiting growth control may be lost.- The reaction products should be volatile and neither easily adsorb to nor etch the growing film. Excessive adsorption of reaction products can affect the self-limiting growth, resulting in CVD-like growth. Etching can lead to a lower GPC and reduce the film's uniformity (see Section 27.7)."

A compound's volatility is affected by intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen- bonding or electrostatic interactions (mainly van der Waals forces), which in turn are influenced in varying degrees by the molecular weight of the precursor and the shape of the molecule (i.e., how easy it is to pack together). Although the vapor pressure of a compound can be measured directly, it is often easier to obtain a TG curve (thermogravimetric analysis), which shows a compound's weight loss as a function of temperature. As a rule of thumb, heavier, symmetrical molecules tend to exhibit low volatilities, whereas lighter, highly asymmetric compounds are very volatile (although there are many exceptions). A standard method of improving volatility is to adopt a heteroleptic precursor (i.e., a metal center with two or more different ligands), which introduces asymmetry, as opposed to a homoleptic molecule (where all the ligands are the same). Furthermore, the intermolecular forces and molecular weight are also influenced by the ligands themselves."

Association: the bonding of an intact precursor or co- reactant with the surface without release of ligands (e.g., hydrogen- bonding). Combustion: an oxidizing co- reactant can combust surface groups and replace them with an oxidized surface. Abstraction: a co- reactant can remove ligands and release reaction products, without leaving behind fragments from the co- reactant, for instance, in conjunction with the reduction of the metal center."

This illustrates that there is no ideal temperature window, as true ALD is occurring at all deposition temperatures yet the GPC is not constant (as in the ideal situation described in Figure 27.4). For plasma ALD at lower temperatures, there is a slightly superlinear increase in the GPC as a result of reduced film density. However, the Al atoms deposited per cycle as a function of temperature shows a consistent linear plot [13]."

Second, pulses of precursors and coreactants need to be injected into the reactor volume, and an inert gas is often used to purge the reactor volume between these steps. Generally, the reactor volume is continuously pumped to achieve a certain pressure. This pressure is typically between 0.1 and 10 Torr, but pressures at the mTorr level and at atmospheric pressure are also viable."

However, contrary to CVD, ALD is not a continuous process and, therefore, the reactor volume has to be filled and purged efficiently to achieve reasonable cycle times. Furthermore, the pulsing of the precursor and co- reactant has to be automated with accurate timing. Note that in the reactor, growth can occur on all reactor surfaces that are exposed to both precursor and co- reactant. Figure 27.14 shows an overview of the reactor types discussed."

This means that precursor and co- reactant exposures occur at different positions using different reaction zones separated by purging areas. Therefore, in order to expose the substrate to these different zones, either the substrate itself or a \"deposition head\" must move. In this case, the throughput is merely limited by the technical specifications of the reactor (e.g., substrate loading, reactor dimensions, etc.) as well as the kinetics of the surface reactions. For processes with typical half- reaction time scales in the order of a few milliseconds, very high deposition rates can be obtained while maintaining a high film quality."

This often becomes an issue when transferring processes from single- wafer tools to batch tools. During the short exposure times used in a single- wafer tool, such a CVD component might be negligible, while the longer exposure times in the batch tool can lead, for instance, to clear nonuniformities for the same ALD process.- Etching: Another chemical side effect is etching, which, for instance, can be an issue with metal halide precursors. The hydrogen halide reaction products (e.g., HCl) can etch the material being deposited, the substrate material, or even the reactor surfaces.- Surface poisoning: This is a chemical side effect in which the reaction products influence the process. In this case, the reaction products compete with the precursor for the surface groups created during the co- reactant exposure. Figure 27.15 shows a schematic description of the poisoning process. Since both reaction products and precursor compete for surface sites, the partial pressures of each reactive species will affect the resulting growth.

In the case of reaction- limited growth (Figure 27.17(a)), which occurs for low reaction probabilities of the precursor or coreactant, an equal thickness is observed throughout the trench (i.e., no gradient) even when the process is not saturated. To achieve conformal and saturated growth, the exposure times do not have to be extended compared to the saturated conditions on planar surfaces. Certain low- pressure CVD processes behave similarly and can provide conformal films. For high reaction probabilities or for very high aspect ratio structures, growth is generally diffusion- limited (Figure 27.17(b)), and a growth front is observed, moving from top to bottom, when extending the exposure. Exposure and purge times have to be extended to a large extent compared to the planar case to achieve saturation"

Figure 27.18 shows, schematically, the effect on the average growth per cycle (GPC) of the different scenarios. In the case of an ideal process, there would be an immediate constant GPC, while an accelerated or delayed growth will lead to higher or lower thickness, respectively, after a specific number of cycles. Issues with nucleation of the material to be deposited on a surface can hinder growth of closed thin films, but can also be exploited to obtain controlled growth of islands or even nanoparticles on surfaces [33]."

A good understanding of the basics of ALD is key in recognizing its opportunities in current and emerging applications, as well as advancing the technology even further. Although it was more than 40 years ago when the technique was established as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), ALD has only recently prevailed as pivotal and inevitable for many technologies. It is, therefore, expected that the importance of ALD as a thin- film deposition technique will continue to grow rapidly, complementing deposition techniques such as PVD, CVD,"
