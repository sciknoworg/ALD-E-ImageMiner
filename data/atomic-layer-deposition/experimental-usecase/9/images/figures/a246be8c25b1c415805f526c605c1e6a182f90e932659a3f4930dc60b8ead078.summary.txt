The chart illustrates the relationship between aluminum fraction percentage and resistivity in two different compounds, TMA and DMAI. As the aluminum fraction increases, the resistivity decreases for both compounds until reaching a minimum point around 6% aluminum fraction, after which it starts to increase again.
