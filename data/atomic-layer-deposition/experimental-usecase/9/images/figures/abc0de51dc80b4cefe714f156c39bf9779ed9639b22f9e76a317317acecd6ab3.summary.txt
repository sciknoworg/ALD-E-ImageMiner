The chart illustrates three different cycle types: regular, multistep, and supercycle, each represented by a sequence of steps over time. The regular cycle consists of alternating A and B steps, while the multistep cycle includes an additional C step. The supercycle combines multiple instances of the regular cycle within a larger sequence.
