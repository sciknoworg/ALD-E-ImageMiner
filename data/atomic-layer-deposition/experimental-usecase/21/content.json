        "text": "Thin- film lithium carbonate  $(\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{CO}_3)$  has applications in various electrochemical devices, like Li- ion batteries, gas sensors and fuel cells. ALD of  $\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{CO}_3$  is of interest for these applications as it allows for uniform and conformal coating of high- aspect ratio structures and particles with very precise thickness control. However, there are few studies that focus on its fabrication and characterization. In this work, plasma- assisted and thermal ALD were adopted to grow ultra- thin, conformal  $\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{CO}_3$  films between 50 and  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  using lithium tert- butoxide as a precursor and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma or  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} / \\mathrm{CO}_2$  as co- reactants. More specifically, we focus on the plasma- assisted process by film growth, stability and conductivity studies and emphasize the differences from its more extensively adopted thermal counterpart. Plasma- assisted ALD allows for higher growth per cycle values (0.82 vs. 0.60 Å), lower substrate temperatures and shorter cycle times. The stoichiometry of the films, ranging from  $\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{CO}_3$  to  $\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{O}$ , can be controlled by substrate temperature and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma exposure time. The ionic conductivity for both plasma- assisted and thermal ALD is measured for the first time and is in the order of  $10^{- 10}\\mathrm{Scm}^{- 1}$  after normalizing to the different effective surface areas. The Li- ion conductivities found here are in line with literature values predicted by simulation studies.",

This is especially applicable in the field of Li- ion batteries, where thin- film 3D battery architectures are currently being investigated. Nanostructured energy storage systems have demonstrated a substantial increase in power and energy density.6- 8 Key to nanostructured energy storage systems is thin films processing of battery active and passive materials compatible with complex battery design. Conventional deposition techniques, such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) and plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE- CVD), do not generally lead to conformal thin layers on high aspect ratio structures. To enable fast charging thin- film batteries, conformality and uniform material composition in extreme aspect ratios are required. Therefore, novel deposition techniques leading to enhanced control in thin film properties and conformality are being presently introduced in the field of Liion batteries.10- 12 Atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is based on sequential and self- limiting half- reactions between precursors (co- reactants) and surface, has emerged as a powerful tool since it shows potential towards exceptional conformality on high- aspect ratio structures, thickness control at sub- nanometer level, and tunable film properties.13 Promising applications of ALD for Li- ion batteries include (surface modification of) particle- based electrodes, 3D- structured electrodes, and 3D all- solid- state microbatteries.10- 12,14,15 Due to the excellent conformality and thickness control of ALD, is suggested that ALD of lithium carbonate  $(\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{CO}_3)$  is especially beneficial when it is employed as electrode passivating film or as additive to improve electrode performance.",

This value is higher than what is expected for typical oxide films. However, the large surface roughness of the thermal films must be considered (see ESI Fig.  $\\mathrm{S4}\\dagger$  ). Such roughness increases the effective contact area of the capacitor which is not included when using the geometrical surface area.

However, no difference in mass density could be detected between the thermal and plasma  $\\mathrm{Li}_2\\mathrm{CO}_3$  layers (see Table 2). Therefore, it is unlikely that a significant difference in dielectric constant exists between the two layers. When considering the morphology of the layers (see Fig. 8), a columnar structure can be seen. Therefore, the liquid electrolyte may contact the individual grains. Clearly this would lead to a significant increase in contact area and thus an increased capacitance value. The distribution in grain size can in such case lead to a distribution in time constants. The two resistance values extracted from the fitting, each correspond to a Li- ion conductivity value in the order of  $1\\times 10^{- 9}\\mathrm{Scm}^{- 1}$  . However, the underestimation of the contact area introduces a significant uncertainty on this value which, based on the increased surface area, will be overestimated. When normalizing the conductivity value found here to the ratio of the different effective surface areas of the thermal and plasma samples, a conductivity value of  $10^{- 10}\\mathrm{Scm}^{- 1}$  is obtained, a value again in line with other literature reports.32",

Especially the use of plasma allows for the possibility to deposit at lower process temperatures, which would be beneficial for temperature- sensitive substrates.
