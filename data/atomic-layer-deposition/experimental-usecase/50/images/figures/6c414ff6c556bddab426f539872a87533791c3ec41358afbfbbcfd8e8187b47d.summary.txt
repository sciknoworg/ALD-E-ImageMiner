The line chart illustrates the relationship between doping fraction and resistivity, carrier concentration, mobility, and doping efficiency for three different materials (TIB, DMAI, TMA). As the doping fraction increases, the resistivity decreases initially and then increases, while the carrier concentration peaks at a certain point and then decreases. Mobility also shows a peak followed by a decline, and the doping efficiency decreases significantly with increasing doping fraction.
