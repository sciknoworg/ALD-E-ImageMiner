Kessels\\*acDoped ZnO films are an important class of transparent conductive oxides, with many applications demanding increased growth control and low deposition temperatures. Therefore, the preparation of B- doped ZnO films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  was studied. The B source was triisopropyl borate,  $\\mathsf{B}(\\mathsf{O}^{\\dagger}\\mathsf{Pr})_{3}$  (TIB), which has a significantly lower vapour pressure and is a safer alternative precursor to highly toxic diborane(6),  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$ . The doping fraction (DF) of the films was varied by the ratio of ZnO and dopant ALD cycles. The electrical, structural and optical properties of the ZnO:B films were studied as a function of the dopant concentration and deposition temperature, and were compared with ZnO:Al films, where dimethylaluminium isopropoxide,  $\\left[\\mathsf{Al}(\\mathsf{CH}_3)_2(\\mathsf{O}^{\\dagger}\\mathsf{Pr})\\right]_2$  (DMAl) and trimethylaluminium,  $\\mathsf{Al}_2(\\mathsf{CH}_3)_6$  (TMA) were the Al sources. A low resistivity of  $3.5\\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\mathrm{cm}$  was achieved for  $45\\mathrm{nm}$ - thick ZnO:B deposited at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  with a doping fraction (DF) of 0.016, which was similar to the results obtained for ZnO:Al films prepared with DMAl and lower compared to the  $8\\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\mathrm{cm}$  achieved for ZnO:Al prepared with TMA at an optimized DF of 0.040. Hence TIB, as well as DMAI, outperformed the conventionally employed TMA in terms of doping efficiency at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . It was found that the optical band gap could be easily tuned over the range of  $\\sim 3.2 - 3.7\\mathrm{eV}$  by modifying the doping fraction.",

The technique also allows for the deposition of virtually defect- free films with tailored compositions (via doping) and it can easily be used to produce multilayer structures. $^{43 - 47}$  Doping is often achieved by combining the steps of two normal ALD processes in a supercycle, where  $m$  cycles of the base material process (in this case  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$ ) are followed by one cycle of the doping material (Fig. 1). The number of cycles  $m$  is chosen to obtain the desired film composition, and the supercycle  $(m + 1)$  is repeated  $x$  times until the desired film thickness is reached.

As part of their studies on the  $\\mathrm{BBr}_3\\mathrm{- H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  ALD process, Putkonen and Ninistö suggested that volatile boric acid,  $\\mathrm{B(OH)_3}$ , was formed instead of  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  when the boron precursor came into contact with excess water under reduced pressure. $^{107}$  The boric acid was then carried away in the vacuum rather than being incorporated into a growing film. We believe that a similar mechanism might take place when TIB is the precursor, which would account for the lack of growth of  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ . However, it was still possible to grow  $\\mathrm{ZnO:B}$  films using TIB incorporated into a supercycle using the DEZ-  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  process. For this reason, the parameters of the ALD process for the B dopant were tuned during the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  doping ALD process at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  using a supercycle with  $m = 4$  (i.e., 5 cycles consisting of  $4\\mathrm{ZnO} + 1$  TIB) and using the already- optimised  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  ALD process parameters (50 ms DEZ dose, 5 s purge, 20 ms  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  dose, 6 s purge). $^{35}$  For the process development, in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used to measure the film thickness after every supercycle. Growth per supercycle (GPSC) values were determined from the slope of the graphs of the thickness as a function of the number of supercycles (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†). We report here the GPSC rather than the growth per cycle (GPC) for the doping process, as it takes into account possible atypical interactions that might occur between the DEZ-  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  and TIB-  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  ALD processes, for example, nucleation delays or etching. $^{35}$",

First of all, the intensity of the (002) peak decreased while that of the (100) peak increased for increasing doping fractions, indicating a change in texture of the ZnO:X films. This effect was more pronounced in the case of DMAI than in the case of TIB as shown in Fig. 7a. As a guide to the eye, the ratio  $I_{002} / I_{100}$  for a powder pattern, i.e., the pattern characteristic for a film with randomly oriented crystals, has been included to illustrate the change in texture from  $\\langle 002\\rangle$  to  $\\langle 100\\rangle$ . Secondly, a significant shift of the peaks to higher  $2\\theta$  values was observed for increasing B fractions, which was likely due to compressive stress in the ZnO unit cell caused by the substitution of  $\\mathrm{Zn^{2 + }}$  (ionic radius of  $0.60 \\mathrm{\\AA}$ , assuming a four- coordinate environment as expected for wurtzite structures) $^{132}$  with smaller  $\\mathrm{B^{3 + }}$  ions (four- coordinate ionic radius of  $0.11 \\mathrm{\\AA}$ ). $^{132}$  This effect was significantly smaller in the case of ZnO:Al films doped by DMAI  $\\mathrm{Al^{3 + }}$ , four- coordinate ionic radius of  $0.39 \\mathrm{\\AA}$ . $^{132}$  Fig. 7b shows the shift of the (002) peak as a function of the doping fraction, as a consequence of the compression of the unit cell (i.e. a decrease of the  $c$ - lattice parameter) with increasing doping fractions. It should be noticed that the  $c$ - lattice parameter for the pure ZnO films (i.e.,  $\\mathrm{DF} = 0$ ) was slightly larger  $(5.219 \\mathrm{\\AA})$  than the value reported for the wurtzite ZnO crystal lattice  $(5.207 \\mathrm{\\AA})$ . This slight difference could be attributed to a combination of measurement inaccuracies (i.e., scan step size or a small sample misalignment in the  $z$ - direction), and sample conditions (i.e., stress in the film, or relatively small crystals).",

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a very promising technique to deposit high quality TCOs as doping materials can be introduced with greater control than with other deposition methods. Aluminium is by far the most common element to dope zinc oxide and especially trimethyl aluminium (TMA) is used as a precursor during ALD. The application of other dopants has been far less reported. For instance, B as a dopant has been scarcely reported for ALD probably due to the highly toxic nature of the traditional boron precursor diborane. We report here the feasibility of using a new, relatively safe boron precursor, triisopropyl borate (TIB), for the atomic layer deposition of ZnO:B. To benchmark the properties of the ZnO:B films, we also deposited ZnO:Al films using dimethylaluminium isopropoxide (DMAI) and TMA as alternative and conventional Al sources, respectively.",

The DMAI precursor resulted in similar high doping efficiencies  $(n = 30 - 40\\%)$  to TIB. The conductivities and carrier concentrations of the films deposited using TIB and DMAI were significantly higher at lower doping fractions than that of ZnO:Al films where TMA was the aluminium source. The mobilities of ZnO:B films were significantly higher than those of the ZnO:Al films doped with DMAI and TMA at low doping fractions. Additionally, the transparency of the ZnO:B films was very high in most of the visible and near- infrared range. The excellent electrical and optical properties of selected ALD ZnO:B films deposited using TIB can be exploited to prepare, for instance, transparent conductive oxide films for silicon heterojunction solar cells for which the required thickness is  $\\sim 80 \\mathrm{nm}$  due to the fact that the film acts also as antireflection coating.
