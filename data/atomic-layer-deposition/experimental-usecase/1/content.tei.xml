<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Al 2 O 3 films were deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at temperatures as low as 33 °C in a viscous-flow reactor using alternating exposures of Al(CH 3 ) 3 (trimethylaluminum [TMA]) and H 2 O. Low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films have the potential to coat thermally fragile substrates such as organic, polymeric, or biological materials. The properties of lowtemperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films were investigated versus growth temperature by depositing films on Si(100) substrates and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors. Al 2 O 3 film thicknesses, growth rates, densities, and optical properties were determined using surface profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), QCM, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Al 2 O 3 film densities were lower at lower deposition temperatures. Al 2 O 3 ALD film densities were 3.0 g/cm 3 at 177 °C and 2.5 g/cm 3 at 33 °C. AFM images showed that Al 2 O 3 ALD films grown at low temperatures were very smooth with a root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of only 4 ( 1 Å. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements showed good electrical properties of the low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films. Elemental analysis of the films using forward recoil spectrometry revealed hydrogen concentrations that increased with decreasing growth temperature. No other elements were observed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry except the parent aluminum and oxygen concentrations. Low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD at 58 °C was demonstrated for the first time on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) polymeric substrate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The coating of thermally fragile substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD) may provide exciting new applications of ALD in diverse areas ranging from food packaging to microelectronics to biomaterials. For example, thin ALD films may serve as gas diffusion barriers in food packaging and extend shelf life by decreasing oxygen diffusion through potato chip bags or slowing the escape of CO 2 from pressurized soda containers. 1,2 ALD coatings on polymers may also be important as gas diffusion barriers for flexible electronic devices or organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> However, few ALD processes have been demonstrated at low temperatures of &lt;100 °C. Room-temperature catalytic SiO 2 ALD has been demonstrated with SiCl 4 and H 2 O plus pyridine 5 or NH 3 6 as the catalyst. ALD of ZnSe and CdS has also been demonstrated at room temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">7</ref> The vast majority of ALD processes occur at temperatures of &gt;100 °C that would degrade organic, polymeric, or biological material.</p><p>Al 2 O 3 is one of the most widely studied materials grown by ALD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[17]</ref> Al 2 O 3 is a well-behaved ALD system that can be accomplished with a variety of precursors and relatively short cycle times.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Section</head><p>A. Chemicals and Substrates. Al2O3 ALD films were grown using H2O (Fisher, optima grade) and Al(CH3)3 [trimethylaluminum (TMA)] (Akzo-Nobel, semiconductor grade, 99.9999%). The carrier gas in the viscous flow reactor was N 2 (Airgas, ultrahigh purity). Moderately doped n-type Si(100) wafers from Montco Silicon Technologies, Inc., with a boron doping density of ∼2 × 10 17 cm -3 were used as substrates.</p><p>A variety of chemicals were used for etching and cleaning of the Si substrates. These chemicals included 5% HF (general chemicals class 10 water/HF (10:1) mix), water (HPLC grade), sulfuric acid, and hydrogen peroxide (30%). Prior to deposition, the silicon wafers were cut into ∼2.5 cm × 2.5 cm pieces, cleaned in a ∼60 °C Piranha solution for 15 min, and then HF etched for 60 s.</p><p>For gas diffusion tests, uncoated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles were supplied by Applied Films Corp. The bottles were 510-mL Coke Contour bottles. These PET bottles had a weight of 28 g and a petalloid shaped base. The PET bottles were cleaned with Micro cleaner/oxide remover (International Products Corp.) prior to deposition.</p><p>B. Al 2O3 ALD Film Growth in Viscous-Flow Reactor. Al2O3 films were grown by ALD in a viscous-flow ALD reactor. This reactor has been described in detail in other publications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> TMA and H2O were alternately entrained in the N2 carrier flow using gas switching valves. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> The N2 carrier gas pressure was ∼1.0 Torr. TMA and H2O pressure transient increases of ∼0.1 Torr were measured by a Baratron when the reactants were introduced into the N2 carrier flow.</p><p>The Al2O3 ALD film growth proceeded according to two selflimiting surface reactions. The TMA and H2O yield Al2O3 ALD according to the following two reactions: <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">10</ref> where the asterisks denote the surface species. When performed in an ABAB... reaction sequence, these sequential reactions produce linear, atomic-layer controlled Al 2O3 growth. Many previous studies have confirmed linear and conformal growth using TMA and H 2O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> The standard flow tube was used to deposit Al2O3 ALD films on Si substrates or the QCM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the reactor with a larger-than-normal flow tube designed to accommodate the PET bottles. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> also shows a simplified diagram of the gas switching valves and the gas reservoirs. The gas switching valves allow for a rapid turn-on and shut-off of the reactant gases for short ALD cycle times. This short time is facilitated by pumping the gas reservoirs with separate mechanical pumps after the reactant exposures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> The time for one complete Al2O3 ALD cycle ranged from 12 s at 177 °C to 203 s at 33 °C. This cycle time was defined by (t 1, t2, t3, t4) where t1 is the TMA exposure time, t2 is the N2 purge time following the TMA reactant exposure, t3 is the H2O exposure time, and t4 is the N2 purge time following the H2O reactant exposure. All times are in units of seconds. Longer purge times were required at lower temperatures to avoid Al 2O3 chemical vapor deposition (CVD) resulting from insufficient purge times.</p><p>Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies of Al2O3 ALD were performed in situ using a Maxtek TM400 thin-film deposition monitor. The QCM crystal housing was sealed and purged to prevent deposition on the backside and positioned horizontally in the flow reactor tube. A detailed description of the QCM for monitoring ALD has been presented in a previous publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> Al2O3 ALD films were deposited on PET bottles at 58 °C. To accommodate the 510-mL PET bottles, the standard reactor flow tube was replaced with a larger 10-cm diameter tube as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This tube consisted of the bottom halves of two vacuum traps joined by an O-ring and a clamp. The bottles were suspended in this enlarged reactor tube by a custom-made cap and purge line that allowed the bottle to be pressurized with N 2 gas during Al2O3 ALD. The pressurization prevented bottle deformation during and after the Al2O3 ALD film growth.</p><p>C. Al2O3 Film Characterization. Al2O3 film thicknesses and refractive indices were measured using a J. A. Woollam M44 variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE). Measurements were obtained over the spectral range from 406 to 806 nm using an incidence angle of 75°. Al 2O3 and SiO2 have virtually identical optical constants. Consequently, a simple ellipsometric measurement yields only the sum of the Al 2O3 and SiO2 film thicknesses. To determine the true Al2O3 thickness and the thickness of any interfacial SiO2 layer on Si(100), a procedure was employed that utilized simultaneous Al 2O3 ALD growth on both an HF-etched Si wafer and a Si wafer with a native oxide. This procedure was described in detail in another publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">11</ref> A 13 ( 2 Å thick interfacial SiO2 layer was determined to be present at the Al2O3/Si interface after Al2O3 ALD. This SiO2 thickness was subtracted from the ellipsometric measurements to determine the Al2O3 layer thickness.</p><p>Atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the Al2O3 films and substrates were obtained using an AutoProbe CP Research scanning probe microscope (SPM) instrument from Thermo-Microscopes. RMS surface roughness values were calculated on the basis of 1 µm 2 contact-mode AFM scans. Profilometry was performed using a Dektak 3 surface profile measuring system from Veeco Metrology Group. Al 2O3 film thicknesses were determined by measuring step heights using profilometry and contact-mode AFM. Well-defined steps needed for AFM imaging were created by masking part of the sample with a small piece of high-temperature aluminum foil tape (3M, Type 433) during Al 2O3 ALD. Other methods, such as clamping another piece of silicon to the substrate, were found to produce poorly defined steps that were too wide to be imaged by AFM.</p><p>Electrical measurements were performed using a MDC 811 mercury probe from the Materials Development Corporation. These electrical measurements have been described in another publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">11</ref> The mercury probe makes contact to the front surface of the Al2O3 films by drawing up a well-defined column of Hg with a surface area of 0.437 mm 2 . Current-voltage (IV) measurements were obtained using a Keithley 487 picoammeter/voltage source. Capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements were performed using a Stanford Research Systems SR720 LCR meter. The experiments were computer-controlled using LabView from National Instruments.</p><p>Elemental analysis was performed at the Ion Beam Analysis Laboratory in the Institute of Technology Characterization </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(A) Al-OH* + Al(CH 3 ) 3 f Al-O-Al(CH 3 ) 2 * + CH 4 (B) Al-CH 3 * + H 2 O f Al-OH* + CH 4</formula><p>Facility at the University of Minnesota. Al and O were determined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) using a 3.5 MeV 4 He 2+ and 2.4 MeV 4 He + beam, respectively. H was determined by 1.3 MeV 4 He + forward recoil spectrometry (FReS). The instrument is composed of a NEC 1.7 MV Pelletron accelerator with a Charles Evans RBS 400 endstation. The He beam incident angle was 75°. The RBS detector was located at 165°and the FReS detector was located at 30°f rom the beam direction. A 5-µm-thick Mylar foil was placed in front of the FReS detector to filter the scattered 4 He particles. The error was estimated at less than 5%.</p><p>X-ray reflectivity (XRR) was performed with a Bede Scientific Ltd. D1 System using a channel cut crystal. The X-ray wavelength from the Cu KR X-ray tube was 1.54 Å. The electron beam current in the X-ray tube was 20 mA at 35 kV. A θ-2θ scan was performed with a 10-arcsec step size and a 5-s acquisition time. The Bede Refs software with a genetic algorithm was used to fit the XRR data and calculate the densities of the films.</p><p>Gas diffusion tests on the Al 2O3 ALD-coated PET bottles were performed by Applied Films Corporation using a GMS barrier measurement system (Balzers Process Systems, GmbH). The bottles were pressurized with up to 6 bar of CO 2 gas. The loss of CO2 was then measured over 3 to 4 days. The CO2 loss rate of an Al2O3 ALD-coated PET coated bottle was compared with the CO2 loss rate of an uncoated bottle. This ratio of these loss rates determined the CO2 barrier improvement factor (BIF).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>A. Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Al 2 O 3 ALD was characterized at different growth temperatures from 33 to 177 °C using a QCM. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows Al 2 O 3 ALD at 58 °C using a (1, 10, 2, 30) cycle time. The Al 2 O 3 ALD film growth is very linear with number of AB reaction cycles. A mass gain per cycle of 30 ng/cm 2 was measured for the Al 2 O 3 ALD growth shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. A more detailed view of the QCM data is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The QCM data for three ALD cycles shows the mass gain for each TMA and water exposure. The time periods during which the TMA and H 2 O dosing valves were open are denoted by the shaded regions. A larger mass gain is observed during the TMA exposure than during the H 2 O exposure. This behavior is similar to that previously observed during QCM studies of Al 2 O 3 ALD at 177 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> The QCM data were used to determine the optimal reactant exposures and nitrogen purge times for Al 2 O 3 ALD at low temperatures. At 177 °C, QCM data from this work and a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> showed that 1-s exposure times and 5-s purge times were sufficient for complete reaction and purging of all of the reactants to prevent CVD. Both the required exposure times and purge times increased with decreasing temperatures.</p><p>The dependence of the Al 2 O 3 ALD mass gain on reactant exposure time at 58 °C is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. These curves were obtained by monitoring QCM data while varying the individual reactant exposure times to determine the minimum precursor exposures necessary for the TMA and H 2 O reactions to reach completion. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows the effect of purge times on the Al 2 O 3 ALD growth rates. Purge times were chosen to be long enough to avoid reactant mixing and subsequent CVD. The CVD growth is indicated by the rise in mass gain per cycle at short purge times. On the basis of these studies, the optimal cycle time for Al 2 O 3 ALD growth at 58 °C was (1, 10, 2, 30) where all times are in units of seconds.</p><p>QCM experiments confirmed that Al 2 O 3 ALD is possible at temperatures as low as 33 °C. This temperature was the lowest temperature that could be achieved without actively cooling the viscous flow reactor. However, the required H 2 O purge time was 180 s at 33 °C. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the reactant exposure and purge times used to perform Al 2 O 3 ALD at growth temperatures ranging from 33 to 177 °C. The resulting Al 2 O 3 ALD mass gains per cycle determined by the QCM are also given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.  QCM measurements indicated a maximum mass gain per cycle of 39 ng/cm 2 at 125 °C. A slight decrease to 38 ng/cm 2 in the mass gain per cycle was measured at 177 °C. Below 125 °C, the mass gain per cycle decreases with decreasing growth temperature and reaches a value of 30 ng/cm 2 at 33 °C.</p><p>B. Spectroscopic Ellipsometry. Al 2 O 3 ALD film thicknesses and the refractive index, n, were determined at wavelengths from 406 to 806 nm using spectroscopic ellipsometry. For Al 2 O 3 films grown using 300 reaction cycles, the film thickness increased from 332 Å at 33 °C to 401 Å at 125 °C. The film thickness then decreased slightly to 375 Å at 177 °C. These measurements yield Al 2 O 3 ALD growth rates of 1.11, 1.34, and 1.25 Å/cycle, respectively. Al 2 O 3 ALD growth rates over the entire growth temperature range are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>.</p><p>The refractive indices decreased slightly with decreasing growth temperature. The results of these measurements are also shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. The refractive indices varied by &lt;1% over the spectral range from 406 to 806 nm. Consequently, the analysis was performed by assuming that the refractive index was constant over the entire wavelength range. The maximum refractive index was n ) 1.60 at 177 °C. The refractive index decreased to n ) 1.51 at 33 °C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>   AFM was also used to determine the surface roughness of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films. The low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films were all very smooth. The root-mean-squared (RMS) surface roughness for a 1 × 1 µm 2 area averaged 4 ( 1 Å. Growth temperature did not affect this surface roughness. The roughness of these films is also similar to that of Al 2 O 3 ALD films grown at higher temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> XRR scans for Al 2 O 3 ALD films grown on Si(100) using 300 reaction cycles at temperatures from 33 to 177 °C are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>. The XRR scans were fitted to determine densities of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films. These fits are also shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>. The density of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films derived by fitting the XRR measurements decreased from 3.06 g/cm 3 at 177 °C to 2.46 g/cm 3 at 33 °C. The XRR density results and comparison of all the density results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>.  Table 1. Reactant Exposure Times, Purge Times, and Mass Gain Per Cycle Determined by the QCM for Al2O3 ALD Films Grown at Temperatures from 33 to 177 °C growth temperature (°C) 177 125 102 80 58 33 TMA exposure time (s) 1 1 1 1 1 1 purge time (s) 5 5 5 5 10 20 water exposure time (s) 1 2 2 2 2 2 purge time (s) 5 10 20 20 30 180 mass gain/cycle (ng/cm 2 ) 38 39 36 34 30 28  IV curve characteristics remained relatively constant versus growth temperature. Low leakage current densiof &lt;10 -7 nA/cm 2 at a 5 V bias were measured even for Al 2 O 3 ALD films grown at 33 °C. Growth temperature did not appear to affect the leakage currents.</p><p>The catastrophic breakdown field decreased slightly with decreasing growth temperature as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>. The breakdown field was 4.4 MV/cm at 177 °C and decreased to 3.7 MV/cm at 33 °C. In addition, there was a decrease in the percentage of spots tested that exhibited good insulating behavior at lower growth temperatures. Capacitance measurements revealed no observable trend versus growth temperature. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> reveals that the dielectric constants of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films averaged k ) 7.7(0.4 over the entire temperature range.</p><p>E. Elemental Analysis. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) analysis measured O/Al ratios close to the expected 1.5 value as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>. The ratios ranged from 1.34 to 1.70. There was no systematic trend with growth temperature. Hydrogen concentrations measured by forward recoil spectrometry (FReS) increased with decreasing growth as displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>. The H atom % in the Al 2 O 3 ALD films increased 6.9% at 177 °C to 21.7% at 33 °C. No other impurities were detected in the Al 2 O 3 ALD films within the detection limit of the RBS.</p><p>F. Gas Diffusion. Gas diffusion tests with CO 2 were carried out on PET bottles coated with Al 2 O 3 ALD films. Bottles were coated with 300 reaction cycles of Al 2 O 3 ALD at 58 °C. This coating procedure should deposit a Al 2 O 3 ALD film with a thickness of 360 Å. The CO 2 gas diffusion test revealed a CO 2 loss rate of 1.55% per week, or 2.91 cm 3 /(day bar cm 2 ). This CO 2 loss rate for the Al 2 O 3 ALD-coated bottle is a factor of ∼1.6 lower than the CO 2 loss rate of an uncoated PET bottle. The ratio of these two CO 2 loss rates yields a barrier improvement factor (BIF) of ∼1.6.</p><p>Volumetric measurements of the PET bottles showed no change in volume as a result of Al 2 O 3 ALD at 58 °C. PET bottles were also coated with 282 and 470 reaction cycles of Al 2 O 3 ALD at a growth temperature of 80 °C and without the N 2 gas pressurization. These PET bottles deformed and increased in volume during deposition. The barrier improvements factors for these Al 2 O 3 ALD-coated PET bottles were much smaller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>A. Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) Measurements. QCM studies showed that both the reactant exposure times and the nitrogen purge times required for Al 2 O 3 ALD increased with decreasing temperatures. Longer reactant exposures at low temperatures are expected because the reaction is thermally activated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">10</ref> The purging of reactants, especially H 2 O, takes longer at low temperatures because of slower desorption of H 2 O from the reactor walls at lower temperatures.</p><p>The completion of the reactions took longer and became less defined, or "softer", at lower temperatures. This "soft" saturation is revealed by the small slope for the mass gain per cycle versus TMA and H 2 O exposure at longer exposure times in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. These small slopes    indicate that either a complete reaction may not have achieved or that the purge times may have become insufficient. Unfortunately, trying to achieve a complete reaction using reactant exposures of tens of seconds is inefficient in terms of time and reactant usage.</p><p>The maximum QCM mass gain per cycle of 39 ng/ cm 2 was recorded at 125 °C as shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. QCM measurements can be employed to calculate film thicknesses. These thickness calculations rely on known density values. For amorphous materials such as the Al 2 O 3 ALD films grown at low temperatures, the density may change with growth temperature. Consequently, additional independent thickness measurements are required to derive the density from the QCM mass measurements.</p><p>B. Thickness Measurements and Al 2 O 3 ALD Growth Rates. The agreement between the different methods of measuring Al 2 O 3 ALD film thicknesses is quite good. Ellipsometric data exhibit less scatter than most of the other methods. The growth rate versus growth temperature obtained by ellipsometry displays a very smooth dependence in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. However, ellipsometry data depend on fitting several parameters to obtain a film thickness. This modeling can also be complicated by the presence of an interfacial SiO 2 layer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">11</ref> Profilometry and AFM step height measurements are more direct determinations of film thickness but tend to be less precise. These measurements depend on the presence of a well-defined, sharp step edge that is not always easy to obtain. However, the film thicknesses obtained by profilometry and AFM agreed fairly well with the film thicknesses obtained by ellipsometry and XRR methods.</p><p>The Al 2 O 3 ALD growth rates shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> reach a maximum of 1.33 Å/cycle at 100 and 125 °C. A previous study observed the maximum Al 2 O 3 ALD growth rate of 1.1 Å/cycle at 177 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9</ref> The position of this maximum was explained by the thermal activation required for the reaction at lower temperatures and decreasing Al-OH and Al-CH 3 surface coverages at higher temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9</ref> The growth rate is determined by reaction kinetics and necessary surface species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">10</ref> There are higher surface coverages at low temperatures, but slower reaction kinetics because of the thermal activation barrier. The reaction kinetics are more rapid at higher temperatures, but the growth rate is limited by the lower surface coverages.</p><p>C. Density. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> shows the densities of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films as determined by a number of different methods. Densities were calculated on the basis of QCM, AFM, ellipsometry, profilometry, XRR, and RBS/FReS data. The density of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films decreased with decreasing growth temperature based on all the different methods. Furthermore, the density values derived from the different methods agree fairly well with each other. Average densities ranged from 3.0 g/cm 3 at 177 °C to 2.5 g/cm 3 at 33 °C.</p><p>The densities of these low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films are significantly lower than the 3.5-3.7 g/cm 3 value typically reported for amorphous Al 2 O 3 . <ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">20</ref> The density of 3.0 g/cm 3 at 177 °C is also lower than the density of 3.5 g/cm 3 derived in a previous study of Al 2 O 3 ALD films. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9</ref> That earlier study derived the density from the refractive index of the film and the Lorentz-Lorenz relationship assuming the optical constants of crystalline Al 2 O 3 . This assumption may not be correct because the Al 2 O 3 ALD film is amorphous. The data in the current study are consistent with an average density of 3.0 g/cm 3 at 177 °C based on many different types of measurements.</p><p>The density versus growth temperature has also been calculated using the Lorentz-Lorenz relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9</ref> Starting with the density of 3.0 g/cm 3 at 177 °C, densities for the Al 2 O 3 ALD films grown at lower temperature were determined on the basis of their refractive indices, n. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> shows that the densities derived using the Lorentz-Lorenz relationship yield good agreement with the other Al 2 O 3 ALD film densities.</p><p>D. Optical and Electrical Properties. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows that the refractive index of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films decreased slightly with decreasing growth temperatures. This trend has been reported elsewhere and was attributed to decreased density and to increased impurity levels in films grown at lower temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">14</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">12</ref> shows the refractive index of the low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films compared with the refractive index of Al 2 O 3 ALD films measured in other studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">21</ref> There is good agreement between the refractive indices in the region of overlap between 150 and 200 °C.</p><p>The refractive index increases with increasing growth temperature up to ∼300 °C. The refractive index is then constant at n ≈ 1.67 for growth temperatures between 300 and 500 °C. For comparison, the crystalline R-Al 2 O 3 sapphire form of alumina has a refractive index of n ) 1.76. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">15</ref> This comparison indicates that the amorphous Al 2 O 3 ALD film with n ≈ 1.67 will densify further upon crystallization. This densification could lead to tensile stress and film cracking.</p><p>IV and CV measurements revealed good electrical properties for films grown at low temperatures.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> also shows that the dielectric constant did not decrease with decreasing growth temperatures. However, the scatter in the measurements may have masked a small change.</p><p>E. Film Composition. The RBS analysis of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films obtained O/Al ratios close to the expected ratio of 1.5. In addition, FReS analysis revealed hydrogen concentrations in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> that increased with decreasing growth temperatures. The increasing hydrogen concentrations continue a trend that was observed in a previous study for Al 2 O 3 ALD growth temperatures from 350 to 125 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">11</ref> The increasing hydrogen concentration at low temperatures may be directly related to the lower density of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films at lower growth temperature.</p><p>At lower temperatures, the hydroxyl surface coverage is higher on Al 2 O 3 surfaces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">10</ref> In addition, the TMA reaction with the Al-OH surface species groups does not go to completion at low temperatures. 9,10 During Al 2 O 3 ALD, the hydroxyl species can build up in the growing Al 2 O 3 film. At 180 °C, the hydroxyl concentration in the film after 10 AB cycles is equal to approximately the full hydroxyl coverage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">10</ref> Annealing at 1000 K can reduce hydroxyl accumulation in Al 2 O 3 ALD films. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">10</ref> These previous studies support the idea that the H atoms in the low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films are present in the form of Al-OH species.</p><p>Despite the high hydrogen concentrations at low temperatures, the Al 2 O 3 ALD films still exhibited remarkably good properties. Low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films may be used for various applications where the high hydrogen concentration is not crucial. On the basis of the results at 33 °C, growing Al 2 O 3 ALD films at room temperature is possible. The major problem is slow H 2 O desorption from the reactor walls and very long required H 2 O purge times. Shorter cycle times could be achieved using a modified reactor design and alternate oxygen sources such as N 2 O, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">22</ref> NO 2 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">16</ref> or alkoxides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">23</ref> F. Gas Diffusion Tests. The PET bottles coated with 300 reaction cycles of Al 2 O 3 ALD at 58 °C displayed a decrease in CO 2 gas diffusion rates. However, lower CO 2 diffusion rates and higher barrier improvement factors (BIF) are desired for commercial applications. Light microscopy images of the surface of the PET bottle revealed apparent scratches and/or cracks on the surface of the Al 2 O 3 ALD-coated bottles. These scratches and/ or cracks may explain the low BIF for these Al 2 O 3 ALD films compared with typical BIFs for SiO 2 coatings. 24</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Al 2 O 3 ALD growth has been demonstrated at temperatures as low as 33 °C. Many of the properties of these low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films were comparable with the properties of Al 2 O 3 ALD films grown at higher temperatures of g177 °C. The low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films exhibited very low surface roughness values, low leakage currents, high dielectric constants, and growth rates in excess of 1 Å/cycle. Good thin film properties were observed despite decreasing densities and increasing hydrogen concentrations observed at lower temperatures. Increased ALD cycle times were necessary at lower temperatures because of the slower reaction rates and longer required purge times for the H 2 O reactant. Improvements in reactor design and the use of alternate oxygen sources could help overcome this problem. Low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD may have applications for coating thermally fragile substrates such as organic, polymeric, or biological material. As a demonstration of the possible applications, low-temperature Al 2 O 3 ALD films were grown on PET bottles to reduce gas diffusion. The Al 2 O 3 ALD-coated PET bottles displayed lower CO 2 gas diffusion rates than uncoated PET bottles.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
