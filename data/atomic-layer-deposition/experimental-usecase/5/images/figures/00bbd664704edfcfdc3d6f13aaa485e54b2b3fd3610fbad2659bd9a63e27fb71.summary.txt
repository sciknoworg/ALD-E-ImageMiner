The contour plot illustrates the relationship between the number of dimethylamine molecules produced during the TDMAT reaction (x-axis) and the QCM mass ratio R=(m0+m1)/m0 (y-values). As the number of dimethylamine molecules increases, the QCM mass ratio also increases, with different curves representing various values of y.
