<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Surface chemistry and film growth were examined during titanium nitride (TiN) atomic layer deposition (ALD) using sequential exposures of tetrakis-dimethylamino titanium (TDMAT) and NH . This ALD system is shown to be far from ideal and illustrates 3 many potential problems that may affect ALD processing. These studies were performed using in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. Ex situ measurements also analyzed the properties of the TiN ALD films. The FTIR studies revealed that TDMAT reacts with NH * species on the TiN surface following NH x 3 exposures to deposit new Ti(N(CH ) ) * species.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Thin film diffusion barriers are required in semiconductor devices to prevent the migration of metal atoms from the interconnects into the adjacent dielectric and semiconductor regions w1x. Titanium nitride (TiN) is one of the most widely used diffusion barrier materials w1x. TiN is a hard, refractory material and has a bulk resistivity of 22 mV cm. The shrinking of device dimensions demands thinner diffusion barrier films deposited in higher aspect ratio contact holes and vias. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be an ideal technique for growing conformal films on high aspect ratio structures. ALD utilizes two sequential self-limiting reactions that occur between a gaseous precursor and the solid substrate. By repeating these surface reactions in an ABAB« binary sequence, a thin film can be deposited with atomic layer thickness control w2,3x.</p><p>A wide variety of materials can be deposited by ALD w4x. Established TiN ALD techniques rely on titanium chloride precursors and are based on the binary chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reaction w5-7x:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3TiCl q4NH ™3TiNq12HClq1y2N</formula><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">4 3 2</formula><p>Unfortunately, titanium chloride precursors are not optimal for the fabrication of diffusion barriers. The high temperatures of 400 8C required for TiN ALD growth using titanium chlorides are incompatible with semiconductor backend processing. The HCl reaction product can also combine with the NH precursor to Recently, alternative TiN ALD schemes have been developed employing the non-halogenated precursors tetrakis-ethylmethylamino titanium (TEMAT) w9,10x and tetrakis-dimethylamino titanium (TDMAT) w11x. The TiN CVD reaction using TDMAT and NH is 3 w12,13x:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Ti N CH q4y3NH ™TiNq4HN CH q1y6N Ž Ž . . Ž .</formula><p>2 4 2 3 3 3 2</p><p>(2)</p><p>Because of their relevance to TiN CVD, the gas phase and surface reactions of TDMAT and NH have received 3 much attention w12-19x. The reaction given by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is believed to occur by a combination of transamination exchange and amine elimination reactions w15x.</p><p>Based on previous TiN CVD studies, TiN ALD may proceed by the following possible binary reaction sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">U (A) 2NH qTi N CH Ž Ž . . 2 4 3 U ™N Ti N CH q2HN CH (3) Ž Ž . .

Eqs.</p><p>(3) and (4) are both transamination exchange reactions in which the NH * surface species are replaced by</p><p>x Ti(N(CH ) ) * surface species and vice versa. Note that 3 2 y the Ti changes its oxidation number from 4 to 3 in Eq. (4). This change is necessary to achieve the correct Ti oxidation number in bulk TiN. Previous TiN ALD investigations using TEMAT and NH have concentrated on optimizing the growth con-3 ditions to improve the physical properties of the resulting TiN films w9,10x. These TiN ALD studies were presented under the assumption that this system displays ideal ALD behavior. Few studies have been reported for TiN ALD using TDMAT w11x. The present study explores the surface chemistry and film growth of TiN using sequential exposures to TDMAT and NH . Fourier 3 transform infrared (FTIR) absorption measurements were performed in situ under high vacuum conditions to verify the exchange of surface functional groups. In situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements were conducted in a viscous flow ALD reactor to determine the mass changes during the individual TDMAT and NH sequential exposures. A variety of ex 3 situ techniques were also utilized to determine the properties of the TiN ALD films. These studies illustrate that TiN ALD using TDMAT and NH does not display 3 ideal ALD behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">FTIR studies</head><p>In situ FTIR transmission measurements were performed in a vacuum apparatus equipped with a Nicolet Magna 560 spectrometer and an MCT-B detector w20-22x. The stainless steel chamber was maintained at high vacuum using a turbomolecular pump. The infrared beam entered the vacuum chamber through a CsI window, passed through the sample substrate and exited through a second CsI window. During reactant exposures, the turbomolecular pump and CsI windows were isolated from the chamber by closing gate valves. A Baratron capacitance manometer and leak valves were used for controlling the reactant exposures. In between exposures, the chamber was evacuated to a pressure -5=10 Torr to remove the ALD reaction products y7 and unreacted precursors.</p><p>The sample substrate for the FTIR studies consisted of ZrO powder pressed into a tungsten support grid 2 w21-23x. Tantalum metal foils spot-welded to each side of the tungsten grid allowed the sample to be suspended by copper clamps and resistively heated. The sample temperature was monitored using a chromel-alumel thermocouple attached to the bottom edge of the tungsten grid using ceramic adhesive. Pressures of ;0.1 Torr were used for the exposures of TDMAT (Schumacher electronic grade, )99.999%). Pressures of 10 Torr were used during the exposures of NH (Aldrich 3 anhydrous, )99.99%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">QCM studies</head><p>The in situ QCM studies were performed in a homebuilt viscous flow ALD reactor w24x. The QCM was housed in a 3.5-cm diameter stainless steel flow tube that could be resistively heated between 60 and 240 8C. An ultrahigh purity nitrogen carrier flow of 200 sccm supplied by a pair of mass flow controllers continuously passed through the flow tube and into a mechanical pump. The nitrogen gas was further purified by an Aeronex gate keeper inert gas purifier. The purifier reduces the contamination level of O , CO, CO , H 2 2 2 and H O in the nitrogen gas to less than 1 ppb. The 2 nitrogen carrier gas transported the precursor vapors to the QCM and swept away the unreacted precursors and reaction products. A steady-state pressure of ;1 Torr and a carrier gas velocity of ;2.5 mys were maintained in the flow tube by adjusting a throttle valve located above the mechanical pump. TDMAT and NH pulses were injected into the 3 nitrogen carrier gas using computer controlled solenoid valves. The TDMAT was held in a stainless steel bubbler maintained at 36 8C to provide a TDMAT vapor pressure of ;0.25 Torr. During the TDMAT exposures, an ultrahigh purity nitrogen flow of 100 sccm provided by a separate mass flow controller passed through the TDMAT bubbler and into the flow reactor. Using the conductances of the TDMAT delivery tubes, the nitrogen mass flow rate through the TDMAT bubbler and the total mass flow rate through the reactor, the TDMAT pressure at the QCM is estimated to be ;0.025 Torr.</p><p>At the end of each TDMAT exposure, the nitrogen flow through the TDMAT bubbler was diverted into a separate mechanical pump. During the NH exposures, the 3 NH pressure in the flow tube was adjusted to be ;0.65 3 Torr using the NH pressure regulator and a needle 3 valve located downstream of the NH solenoid valve.</p><p>3</p><p>The viscous flow ALD reactor was equipped with a QCM enabling in situ film growth measurements. Polished QCM sensors from Colorado Crystal Corporation (Part ࠻ CCAT1BK-1007-000) were mounted in a Maxtek BSH-150 bakeable sensor head attached to a 2.75inch conflat flange. The sensor head was modified to provide a nitrogen flow of ;20 sccm over the back surface of the sensor crystal to prevent backside deposition w24x. A Maxtek TM400 film thickness monitor interfaced to a computer measured the QCM sensor signals. The thickness monitor allowed mass measurements with a resolution of 0.375 ngycm at 10 Hz. </p></div>

The properties of the TiN ALD films were evaluated as a function of the deposition temperature and the ALD cycle timing.

These measurements employed a Perkin Elmer PHI5500 XPS equipped with a hemispherical energy analyzer and a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Ka, 1486.6 eV). The binding energy scale was calibrated by setting the C 1s peak of carbon at 284.8 eV.

A concurrent increase in absorbx ance is observed in the 2700-3000 cm frequency y1 region corresponding with a gain in C-H stretching vibrations from the dimethylamino species. The spectra in Fig. 1 have been offset for clarity in presentation. A TDMAT exposure of 3 Torr min is sufficient for the TDMAT reaction to proceed nearly to completion at 152 8C. Additional TDMAT exposure produces minimal changes in the N-H and C-H stretching regions of the FTIR spectra. In addition to the exchange between the NH * and Ti(N(CH ) ) * surface species shown in Fig. x 3 2 x 1, large TDMAT exposures also produce a continual increase in the background absorbance of the FTIR spectra. NH was then exposed to the TiN surface following 3 the TDMAT exposures. This surface is terminated with Ti(N(CH ) ) * species. The NH exposure removes the 3 2 x 3 dimethylamino surface species. Fig. 2 displays the loss of C-H stretching vibrations and gain of N-H stretching vibrations vs. NH exposure at 152 8C during the fourth 3 NH exposure in the ABAB« sequence. The spectra 3 are again offset for clarity. NH exposures of 600 3 Torr min displace most of the Ti(N(CH ) ) * surface 3 2 x species and replace them with NH * surface species. x Fig. 2 reveals that additional NH exposure produces 3 very little change in the FTIR spectra. The FTIR spectrum after an NH exposure of 3600 Torr min 3 reveals that a residual amount of dimethylamino surface species are not easily reacted by long NH exposures. 3 A comparison of the initial FTIR spectrum in Fig. 1 after the second NH exposure and the FTIR spectrum 3 in Fig. 2 after the fourth saturation NH exposure reveals 3 that the absorbance for the C-H stretching vibration has increased nearly a factor of two. This increase may be caused by the buildup of dimethylamino species in the growing TiN film. The switching behavior vs. TDMAT and NH expo-3  is consistent with the surface chemistry described by Eqs. (3) and (4). Notice that the integrated infrared absorbance for the C-H stretching vibrations after the fourth NH exposure in Fig. 3b has increased relative 3 to the integrated infrared absorbance for the C-H stretching vibration prior to the third TDMAT exposure shown in Fig. 3a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">QCM measurements</head><p>The QCM displayed extremely linear TiN ALD growth during the sequential TDMAT and NH expo-3 sures. The nomenclature for the ALD pulse sequence is t1-t2-t3-t4 where t1 is the TDMAT exposure time, t2 is the purge time following the TDMAT exposure, t3 is the NH exposure time and t4 is the purge time following  TDMAT exposure time at a pressure of ;0.025 Torr. The mass deposition rate is 29.7 ngycm ycycle for a 1 2 s TDMAT exposure and increases to 51.4 ngycm ycycle 2 for a 50 s TDMAT exposure.</p><p>For TDMAT exposure times 50 s, the mass depo-R sition is not self-limiting. In this regime, the TiN deposition displays a continual slow growth of ;0.05 ngycm ys. The right axis shows the growth rates that  The effect of varying the NH exposure time on the 3 TiN mass deposition rate is shown in Fig. 5b. The QCM measurements were performed at 120 8C using the ALD pulse sequence (20-10-x-10). The mass deposition rate increases very rapidly to 35.5 ngycm ycycle for 0.2 2 s NH exposures. The TiN ALD growth rate subsequent-3 ly is self-limiting at 63.1 ngycm ycycle for NH expo-2 3 sures 020 s. Additional QCM experiments examined the effects of independently varying the TDMAT and NH purge 3 times. For pulse sequences of (20-x-6-10), the mass deposition rate decreases only slightly with increasing TDMAT purge times from 57.6 ngycm ycycle at 0.1 s 2 to an average value of 55.8 ngycm ycycle for purge 2 times above ;5 s. In contrast, the mass deposition rate decreases much more noticeably with increasing NH 3 purge times. For pulse sequences of (20-10-6-x), the TiN ALD growth rate decreases from 69.8 ngycm y 2 cycle at 2 s to 46.8 ngycm ycycle for purge times of 2 030 s.</p><p>The QCM measurements do not clearly indicate an optimal timing sequence for TiN ALD. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref> exhibit a rapid initial increase in mass deposition followed by regions of slower change. In particular, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref> does not show self-limiting behavior vs. TDMAT exposure. To explore further the effects of the reactant exposure times, three ALD pulse sequences were selected to investigate the TiN ALD surface chemistry and film growth. The designations and timings for these pulse sequences are: 'short' (1-0.5-1-5), 'medium' (20-10-6-10) and 'long' (100-10-20-30). The exposure times for the short, medium and long pulse sequences are indicated by the solid, dotted and dashed lines, respectively, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>.</p><p>TiN ALD was performed using the short, medium and long timing sequences at deposition temperatures of 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 8C. At each temperature and timing sequence, TiN ALD was performed until the QCM indicated that the TiN film was growing at a constant rate. At this point, the QCM data was recorded for at least 10 ALD cycles. For example, the solid line in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the QCM data measured at 120 8C using the long pulse sequence. The dotted line in this figure is a linear least squares fit to the QCM data and yields a mass deposition rate of 71.0 ngycm ycycle.</p><p>2 Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref> shows an Arrhenius plot of the mass deposition rates obtained from the QCM measurements. The corresponding TiN growth rates are also given assuming a TiN bulk density of 5.22 gycm . For each pulse 3 sequence, the mass deposition rate increases nearly exponentially with deposition temperature. In addition, at a given temperature, the mass deposition rate increases monotonically between the short, medium and long pulse sequences. For the short pulses, the mass deposition rate exhibits an activation energy of 0.12("0.01) eV. The medium and long pulse sequences show activation energies of 0.13("0.01) and 0.12("0.01) eV, respectively, between 60 and 150 8C. Between 180 and 240 8C, the activation energies obtained using the medium and long pulses are 0.35("0.07) and 0.57("0.09) eV, respectively.</p><p>The QCM measurements also revealed changes in the individual QCM pulse shapes with variations in deposition temperature and pulse timing. For example, Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> presents the average QCM pulse shape obtained from 10 ALD cycles using the long exposures at 120 8C. The ALD timing sequence is indicated above the QCM data. During the TDMAT exposure, there is a rapid increase in apparent mass followed by a long period of much slower apparent mass gain. The term 'apparent' is employed because the QCM is sensitive to both mass and temperature changes w25x. Temperature changes may be initiated by perturbations to the gas flow by introducing reactants and subsequently removing the reactants. During the TDMAT purge, some apparent mass is lost. The NH exposure causes a large apparent mass 3 gain of ;80 ngycm . However, all of this apparent 2 mass is lost during the subsequent NH purge. In fact, 3 there is a net apparent mass loss between the end of the TDMAT purge and the end of the NH purge.   plots the QCM mass ratio, Rs(m qm )ym , for each 0 1 0 of the timing sequences and temperatures shown in Fig. 6. For the short pulses, R increases with increasing temperature. The R values for the medium and long pulse sequences are nearly identical and are consistently larger than the R values for the short pulse sequence.</p><p>For the medium and long pulse sequences, the R values increase with increasing deposition temperature except for an initial drop between 60 and 90 8C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Film properties</head><p>The ex situ measurements of film resistivity using the four-point probe are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref>. The resistivity dramatically decreases vs. deposition temperature. The resistivities are also consistently smaller for the short reactant pulses. The smallest resistivity of 1.4=10 4 mV cm is obtained at 240 8C with the short reactant pulses. This resistivity is considerably higher than the bulk TiN resistivity of 22 mV cm.</p><p>The TiN film thicknesses were measured after deposition using a surface profilometer. The in situ QCM results for the deposited film mass were then used together with the ex situ film thicknesses to derive the film density. These film densities are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>. The densities derived from the QCM and surface profilometer measurements are very small at low deposition temperature and increase progressively at higher deposition temperature. In addition, these densities are consistently higher for the short reactant pulses. The QCM and surface profilometer measurements reveal that the highest density of 3.0 gycm is obtained at 240 8C for 3 the short reactant pulses. This density is considerably smaller than the bulk TiN density of 5.22 gycm .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>The low densities observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref> correspond to high film porosity. The right axis of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref> shows the film porosity vs. deposition temperature for the three  reactant exposures calculated using: porosity (%)s 100=(1ydy5.22) where d is the corresponding film density. As expected based on the densities, higher porosities are measured at lower deposition temperatures. The lowest porosities are obtained at 240 8C for the short reactant pulses.</p><p>High film porosity may lead to facile film oxidation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref> shows the chemical composition in atomic percentage measured using ex situ XPS analysis. The XPS measurements in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11a</ref> were performed on TiN ALD films deposited on Si(1 0 0) using the short pulse sequence at deposition temperatures of 60-240 8C. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11b</ref> shows XPS measurements vs. TDMAT exposure for the short, medium and long pulse sequences measured for TiN ALD films deposited on Si(1 0 0) at 180 8C. These XPS measurements reveal that the TiN films are highly oxidized after TiN growth at low temperature. Oxygen is still the dominant film constituent even after TiN growth at 240 8C using the short reactant pulses. This high level of film oxidation may explain the high resistivity values shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref>.</p><p>Grazing incidence XRD was performed on the TiN ALD films deposited on Si(1 0 0) and soda-lime glass substrates. Two weak, broad peaks were observed in the diffraction patterns at 2us36.5 and 42.98. Under-stoichiometric TiN films exhibit strong reflections at 2us 0.7 36.69 and 42.628. Consequently, the XRD measurements suggest that the ALD TiN films are weakly crystalline and rich in titanium.</p><p>The surface morphology of the TiN ALD films deposited on Si(1 0 0) substrates was examined using AFM. The TiN ALD films exhibited a topography typical of amorphous films and were relatively smooth. For instance, the root mean squared (RMS) surface roughness of the TiN ALD films with a thickness of 800 A deposited using the short reactant pulse sequence åt 180 8C was 10 A. The RMS roughness of the TiN ÅLD films increased with film thickness, deposition temperature and reactant exposure times.</p></div>

These findings imply that repeating the reactions given by Eqs.</p><p>(3) and (4) in a binary ABAB« sequence should produce atomic layer controlled growth of TiN films.</p><p>The FTIR spectra also reveal some problems for TiN ALD using TDMAT and NH . The vibrational spectra 3 reveal that the dimethylamino species are progressively building up in the growing TiN film. The integrated absorbance for the C-H stretching vibrations from the Ti(N(CH ) ) * species increases progressively after The FTIR spectra do not observe the growth of distinct TiN infrared absorption features that increase progressively with the sequential TDMAT and NH 3 exposures. However, there is a progressive increase in the background infrared absorption that is consistent with the deposition of a conducting TiN film. Evidence for the slow, non-self-limiting adsorption of TDMAT during TiN ALD is also provided by the continuous increase in the background infrared absorption following large TDMAT exposures. This rise in background absorbance persists even after the C-H stretching vibrations from the Ti(N(CH ) ) * species have reached their 3 2 x maximum absorbance values.</p><p>The variations in the QCM mass ratio, R, with temperature and exposure shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref> can be employed to evaluate the TiN ALD surface chemistry. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> presents three different possible TiN ALD reaction sequences derived from Eqs. (3) and (4) where the number of dimethylamine molecules produced during the TDMAT reaction is varied from xs1, 2 and 3. The Ti atom also changes its oxidation number from 4 to 3 during the NH reaction to obtain the correct 3 oxidation number in bulk TiN.</p><p>The surface species remaining after the NH reaction 3 for xs1 is given as NTiNH*. This species requires a double bond between the Ti atom and the NH ligand to obtain a Ti oxidation number of 3. However, there should be no double bonds in the TiN film. To avoid the double bond, adjacent NTiNH* species could rearrange to form a «Ti-NH-Ti-NH-Ti« structure where no double bonds are present. A rearrangement is also required during the NH reaction for xs3 to obtain a 3 Ti oxidation number of 3. This rearrangement yields the N TiNH * and NH* species. the reaction mechanism given by Eqs.</p><p>(3) and (4). The vertical axis in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref> shows the range of R values observed experimentally in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref> demonstrates that the R values predicted by Eqs.</p><p>(3) and (4) do not span the observed range of R values. Predicted QCM mass ratios R)0.6 are observed only for x)2.6. The maximum R value of R;0.7 is obtained at xs3.0. Alternate reaction mechanisms were evaluated to explain the QCM mass ratio results. The simplest reaction mechanism that explained the observations assumes that some of the dimethylamino ligands on the TDMAT molecule are incorporated into the growing TiN film. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> lists three possible reaction sequences where the number of dimethylamino ligands incorporated into the film is equal to ys0, 1 and 2. The number of dimethylamine molecules released during the TDMAT reaction is assumed to be xs2. The third column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> lists the corresponding QCM mass ratios and demonstrates that R increases with y.</p><p>The general formula for the QCM mass ratio including dimethylamino incorporation is: Rs(62q44y)y(224y 45x) with the constraints: 1(x(3 and y <ref type="bibr">((4yx)</ref>. The R values predicted by this formula are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref> for ys0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref> shows that the R values predicted by the dimethylamino ligand incorporation mechanism span the full range of experimentally observed R values.</p><p>The FTIR and QCM measurements both suggest that dimethylamino ligands may be incorporated in the TiN films. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref> shows that R is expected to increase with increasing dimethylamino ligand incorporation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref> indicates that increasing deposition temperature and exposure times increases R. These similar trends suggest that TiN ALD performed at higher temperatures and larger exposure times may incorporate more dimethylamino ligands. In agreement with this expectation, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11a</ref> shows that the C and N atomic percentage of the TiN ALD films increase with increasing deposition temperature. Likewise, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11b</ref> displays that the C atomic percentage increases slightly with increasing exposure times.</p><p>In addition to dimethylamino incorporation, TiN ALD may be affected by adsorbed NH .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">TiN ALD growth rate</head><p>One ML of TiN has an estimated thickness of d s y1y3 2.7 A and would yield a mass deposition rate of 141 ngycm ycycle. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref> reveals that TiN ALD growth 2 rates )1 ML are measured for the long exposures at the highest growth temperatures. These large growth rates are attributed to the non-self-limiting adsorption of TDMAT and TiN CVD from TDMAT thermal decomposition that occurs at temperatures )180 8C. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref> also demonstrates non-self-limiting adsorption of TDMAT at lower temperatures of 120 8C. Furthermore, the continual increase in the FTIR background absorption observed following large TDMAT exposures at 152 8C also suggests non-self-limited growth.</p><p>The activation energies measured for TiN ALD are consistent with previous measurements of the TDMAT surface reactions. Previously, an activation energy of 0.15 eV was measured for TiN low pressure CVD using TDMAT and NH w16,17x. This value is similar to the 3 activation energies of 0.12-0.13 eV shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref> for the short reactant pulses and the medium and long reactant pulses below 150 8C. This similarity suggests that the TiN ALD and low pressure TiN CVD share a common rate-limiting step. TiN ALD is similar to low pressure TiN CVD because gas phase reactions are not involved during the TiN growth. The larger activation energies measured for the medium and long exposures at temperatures )180 8C are consistent with TiN CVD by thermal decomposition of TDMAT. Activation energies of 0.8 eV have been previously measured for TiN CVD by TDMAT decomposition w27x.</p><p>The TiN ALD growth rates can be used to determine the TDMAT reactive sticking coefficient during TiN ALD. The reactive sticking coefficient is given by Ss QyF. Q is the deposited coverage of Ti atoms measured after a TDMAT exposure and F is the number of TDMAT molecular collisions corresponding to the same TDMAT exposure. Q can be determined from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref> and F is obtained from gas kinetic theory. The initial reactive sticking coefficient calculated from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref> is Ss9=10 . In comparison, the reaction probability y3 reported for TDMAT thermal decomposition on a TiN C surface at 200 8C is ;10 w28x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>y3 x y</head><p>The TiN ALD growth rates shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref> can also be compared with earlier TiN ALD growth rates obtained using the titanium halide or titanium organometallic precursors. TiN ALD growth rates of 0.17 and 0.32 Aycycle are measured at 500 8C using TiCl w5x 4 ånd TiI w8x, respectively. In comparison, earlier reports 4 of TiN ALD using TEMAT w9x and TDMAT w11x yielded TiN ALD growth rates of 5.0 and 4.3 Aycycle, respectively, at 180 8C. These large TiN ALD growth rates were interpreted in terms of additional TEMAT or TDMAT reactant adsorption on the growing TiN surface w9,11x.</p><p>The additional TEMAT or TDMAT reactants are believed to be adsorbed to the TiN surface following the completion of the surface reaction w9,11x. The adsorption of these Lewis bases is reasonable given the strong Lewis acid Ti sites on the TiN surface. Earlier 3q studies have also demonstrated that Lewis bases such as HN(CH ) and NH both can adsorb to the growing 3 2 3 TiN surface w19x. The adsorbed TEMAT or TDMAT reactants then react with NH during the subsequent 3 NH exposure and yield larger TiN ALD growth rates.</p><p>3</p><p>Although the adsorption of additional TEMAT or TDMAT reactants on the TiN surface is reasonable, lower TiN ALD growth rates would be predicted at higher temperatures. Lower TiN ALD growth rates are expected because the adsorbed reactant coverage should decrease with temperature. The opposite trend is observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>. In addition, the QCM mass ratios during TDMAT and NH exposures are inconsistent 3 with additional adsorbed TDMAT reactants persisting on the growing TiN film. Consequently, the large TiN ALD growth rates at higher temperatures are attributed to TDMAT thermal decomposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">TiN ALD film properties</head><p>The TiN ALD films have a very high resistivity that decreases dramatically with growth temperature. The densities of the TiN ALD films are also extremely low. The TiN films have porosities that range from 80 to 42% depending on the growth temperature and reactant exposure length. These high porosities probably lead to the very high oxygen levels observed in the TiN film after air exposure. This assumption could be verified by depositing an Al O ALD capping layer onto the TiN 2 3 film prior to air exposure and subsequently analyzing the TiN film using depth-profiling XPS. The high porosity will seriously compromise the ability of these TiN ALD films to serve as effective diffusion barriers. These porous TiN films are not expected to be effective diffusion barriers for copper. Likewise, the high porosities allow easy oxidation of the TiN films and raise the film resistivity. This high resistivity is also not desirable for a diffusion barrier for backend multilevel interconnects.</p><p>The earlier studies of TiN ALD using the TEMAT titanium organometallic precursor reported TiN growth rates based on surface profilometry measurements w9x. Related studies using TDMAT implied that the results for TEMAT and TDMAT were similar w11x. Unfortunately, these earlier studies did not measure TiN ALD film densities. In addition, the earlier reports did not report the oxygen levels in the TiN ALD films. Either of these measurements would have been able to uncover the high porosity and facile oxidation of these TiN ALD films.</p><p>To examine the differences between TiN ALD using titanium halide and titanium organometallic precursors, a TiN ALD film was grown using 500 cycles of TiCl 4 and NH at 450 8C. This TiN ALD film was then 3 examined using the four-point probe. The TiN film grown using TiCl and NH had a resistivity of 140 4 3</p><p>mV cm. This resistivity compares well with the resistivities measured earlier for TiN films deposited using TiCl and NH w5x. This similarity argues that the higher 4 3 resistivities for the TiN ALD films using TDMAT and NH result from the surface chemistry of the TDMAT 3 precursor. The higher resistivity cannot be attributed to problems with the viscous flow ALD reactor.</p><p>Preliminary results indicate that ex situ hydrogen radical exposure to the TiN ALD films significantly reduces the resistivity. The hydrogen reduction probably partially eliminates oxygen and produces a higher purity TiN film. In situ hydrogen radical exposure may also promote the growth of higher density, lower porosity TiN ALD films. The density of TaN ALD films grown using tantalum organometallics has been reported to be increased using hydrogen radical exposures w29x. The hydrogen radicals may help remove the dimethylamino species and promote the crosslinking of -NH surface 2 species that would densify the TiN ALD film.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>TiN ALD was examined using sequential exposures to TDMAT and NH . These investigations reveal that TiN ALD using TDMAT and NH does not exhibit ideal 3 ALD behavior. The surface chemistry was investigated using in situ FTIR and QCM techniques. The film properties were explored using ex situ four-point probe, surface profilometry, XPS, XRD and AFM analyses. The FTIR measurements were consistent with TiN ALD occurring via surface exchange reactions. TDMAT molecules react with NH * species to deposit new dimethylamino species leads to the buildup of carbon species in the TiN film. The FTIR measurements also revealed a progressive increase in the background absorption during TDMAT exposure that was consistent with a slow, non-self-limiting TDMAT reaction. QCM measurements revealed that sequential TDMAT and NH exposures allow stepwise TiN film growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>The TDMAT and NH surface reactions are nearly self-3 limiting. However, large TDMAT exposures generate a slow, continual growth of ;0.05 ngycm ys at 120 8C.</p><p>2 QCM studies determined that the activation energy for TiN ALD was 0.12("0.01) eV using short exposures. Using long exposures at deposition temperatures )150 8C, the activation energy increases to 0.57("0.09) eV and approaches the activation energy for TDMAT thermal decomposition. The TiN ALD films displayed a very high resistivity that was correlated with high film porosity and high oxygen content after air exposure. The high porosities may be partially attributed to the incomplete reactivity of NH with the dimethylamino 3 surface species. These high porosities and high resistivities will compromise the use of TiN ALD from TDMAT and NH for depositing diffusion barriers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>3 form a nonvolatile NH Cl salt and generate particulate 4 contamination.
