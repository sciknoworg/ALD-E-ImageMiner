The battery stack consists of several functional layers (diffusion barrier layer, anode, electrode, cathode, current collector) deposited conformally in these 3D structures.

Consequently, both Cu and Li diffusion barrier experiments indicate better barrier properties for the TiN films, suggesting that the TiN films prepared by remote plasma ALD yields an overall better barrier performance than the TaN films prepared by remote plasma ALD. Although it is unclear for the moment whether the difference in Cu barrier performance is an intrinsic material property or due to the difference in process conditions used (such as halide precursor at high substrate temperature of  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for TiN and metallorganic precursor at lower substrate temperature of  $225^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  for TaN), future work will focus on TiN addressing its barrier properties when deposited in high aspect ratio structures required for future 3D- SiP devices.",
