The chart illustrates the sheet resistance at 150°C for different stack configurations (TaN-Si, TiN-Si, Cu-TaN-Si, Cu-TiN-Si) across various temperatures. The TaN-Si and TiN-Si stacks show relatively stable resistance values, while the Cu-based stacks exhibit a significant increase in resistance above 600°C.
