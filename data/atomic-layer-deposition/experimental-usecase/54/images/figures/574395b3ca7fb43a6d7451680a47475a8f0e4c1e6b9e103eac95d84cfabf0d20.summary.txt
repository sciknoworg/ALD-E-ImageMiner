The images depict different magnifications of a material's surface morphology using SEM. Chart (a) shows a close-up view at 2 µm scale, revealing a smooth surface. Chart (b) displays a slightly larger area at the same scale, showing a more detailed texture. Chart (c) provides a broader view at 30 µm scale, highlighting the interconnected structures and voids.
