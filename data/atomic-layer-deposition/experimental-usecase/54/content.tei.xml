<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>TaN and TiN films were deposited by remote plasma atomic layer deposition ͑ALD͒ using the combinations of Ta͓N͑CH 3 ͒ 2 ͔ 5 precursor with H 2 plasma and TiCl 4 precursor with H 2 -N 2 plasma, respectively. Both the TaN and TiN films had a cubic phase composition with a relatively low resistivity ͑TaN: 380 ⍀ cm; TiN: 150 ⍀ cm͒. Dissimilar from the TiN properties, the material properties of the TaN films were found to depend strongly on the plasma exposure time. Preliminary tests on planar substrates were carried out revealing the potential of the TaN and TiN films as Cu and Li diffusion barriers in through-silicon via and silicon-integrated thin-film battery applications, respectively. For the specific films studied, it was found that TiN showed better barrier properties than TaN for both application areas. The TiN films were an effective barrier to Cu diffusion and had no Cu diffusion for anneal temperatures up to 700°C. The TiN films showed low Li intercalation during electrochemical charging and discharging.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Diffusion barrier layers are of key importance to ensure device lifetime and functionality of various components. One area placing stringent demands on the barrier layer is Cu interconnect technology. Here, barrier layers are needed to prevent Cu diffusion into the silicon substrate. Because of scaling down of feature sizes, these films need to be thin ͑ϳ5 to 10 nm͒ and deposited conformally in features with increasingly higher aspect ratios. Furthermore, the films need to be conductive to maintain sufficient electrical connection to the underlying metallization layer.</p><p>Copper diffusion barriers are also needed in the emerging field of three-dimensional ͑3D͒ stacked die integration. Here, copper-filled through-silicon vias ͑TSVs͒ offer a solution to the "wiring crisis" in next-generation semiconductor devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> 3D integration and, consequently, Cu diffusion barriers are also of strategic relevance for the "More than Moore" approach in which several functionalities and components ͑computing, processing, storage, transmitting, sensing, etc.͒ are combined in, for example, "System-in-Package ͑SiP͒" devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> A development being part of the "More than Moore" approach is research toward 3D integrated solid-state thin-film batteries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> These batteries have the potential to provide the high-density storage capacity required for future miniaturized autonomous wireless devices or as a backup power supply in circuits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The batteries are based on Li ions as charge carriers and high aspect ratio structures in silicon to obtain high storage densities. The battery stack consists of several functional layers ͑diffusion barrier layer, anode, electrolyte, cathode, current collector͒ deposited conformally in these 3D structures. Because silicon easily takes up elemental Li, it is an attractive anode material. However, to prevent the loss of Li from the Si anode to the underlying Si substrate while still providing an electrical connection to the anode layer, a conductive and conformal Li diffusion barrier film is required in-between. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> As Cu diffusion barrier materials, mainly refractory metallic systems ͑Ti, Ta, W, Mo, Cr, etc. and their nitrides͒ are used due to their characteristic chemical inertness and low diffusion rate related to their high melting points. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Furthermore, because of the relatively low resistivity of these materials they can be directly used as metal electrodes in capacitor structures and as metal gate electrodes for complementary metal oxide semiconductor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Among these mate-rials, TaN and TiN have been considered most often and these materials are known to be good diffusion barriers, especially for Cu. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Both sputtered TaN and TiN have been used as a diffusion barrier for TSV experiments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Note, that the adhesion of Cu on TiN might not be sufficient for the small feature sizes in the more traditional interconnect technology.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Remote plasma ALD reactors.-The TaN and TiN films investigated and used in the barrier experiments were deposited using two remote plasma ALD reactors. The TaN films were deposited using the homebuilt ALD-I reactor as described extensively by Langereis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> The TiN films in this work were deposited using the Oxford Instruments FlexAL reactor, and this process is described by Heil et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> In this work, we describe the deposition of both materials and report on the Cu and Li diffusion barrier properties on planar film stacks.</p><p>Both ALD reactors have the same basic configuration as schematically represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The reactors consisted of a deposition chamber, a pump unit, an inductively coupled plasma source, and a precursor dosing system. The pump unit and plasma source were connected to the deposition chamber through gate valves. The chamber was pumped by a combination of a turbomolecular pump and a rotary pump reaching a base pressure of Ͻ10 -5 Torr by overnight pumping. The ALD-I reactor was an open-load reactor that could handle wafers with a diameter up to 100 mm. The FlexAL reactor could handle wafers with diameters up to 200 mm, and these wafers were loaded through a load lock. Unlike the ALD-I reactor, the FlexAL reactor had a higher maximum power setting for the plasma source ͑600 W instead of 100 W͒ and was also equipped with mass flow controllers and an automated pressure control valve.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> schematically shows a typical ALD cycle used for both processes. The cycle began with the precursor dosage. For the TaN process Ta͓N͑CH 3 ͒ 2 ͔ 5 ͑pentakis͑dimethylamino͒tantalum, PDMAT͒ precursor was heated to 75°C, and an Ar flow was used to transport the Ta͓N͑CH 3 ͒ 2 ͔ 5 vapor into the chamber by bubbling. A dosing time of 5 s was used to obtain saturation. For TiN deposition, TiCl 4 was dosed using a fast switch valve ͑minimum switch time was 10 ms͒. Because of the high vapor pressure of TiCl 4 , only a short dosage time of 40 ms was required to achieve saturation while keeping the TiCl 4 at 30°C. After purging with Ar, the gate valve between plasma source and chamber was opened and the plasma ALD halfcycle was started. For the TaN process, an H 2 plasma was used; for the TiN process, we used an H 2 -N 2 plasma. After the plasma step, the next cycle started again with an Ar purge. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> summarizes the details of the "baseline" conditions used throughout this work.</p><p>Thin-film analysis.-In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry ͑SE͒ was used to study the thin-film growth during the deposition processes on both ALD reactors. The ellipsometer used was a J.A. Woollam, Inc. M2000U visible and near-infrared ͑0.75-5.0 eV͒ ellipsometer. A proper modeling of the dielectric function results in an accurate determination of the thickness of the deposited film. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Electrical sheet resistance measurements were carried out ex situ at room temperature using a Signatone four-point probe ͑FPP͒ in combination with a Keithley 2400 Source Measurement Unit, acting both as cur-rent source and voltage meter. The resistivity was obtained from the slope of the current-voltage ͑I-V͒ curve, and the film thickness was deduced from the SE measurements. The atomic compositions and areal atomic densities of the films were determined from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and elastic recoil detection using 2 MeV 4 He + ions. Mass densities were calculated from the areal densities using the thickness data obtained by SE. The microstructure of the films was studied using X-ray diffraction ͑XRD͒ with a Philips X'Pert MPD diffractometer equipped with a Cu K␣ source ͑1.54 Å radiation͒. The thickness and mass density were corroborated by X-ray reflectometry measurements performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer.</p><p>Cu and Li diffusion barrier experiments.-For the Cu diffusion barrier experiments, test structures were fabricated by sputter depositing Cu films ͑ϳ50 nm in thickness͒ onto air exposed barrier films ͑ϳ30 nm in thickness͒ which were deposited on 100 mm HF-last n-type silicon wafers ͑P-doped, resistivity of 10-20 ⍀ cm͒. These stacks were annealed in a vacuum oven ͑Ͻ10 -6 Torr͒ together with control stacks that had no Cu film on top. For the FPP resistivity measurements, the samples were heated up to the anneal temperature at a ramp rate of 5°C/min. At the moment the anneal temperature was reached, the samples were cooled down to 150°C at a cooling rate of 5°C/min after which the sample was heated to the next anneal temperature. The anneal temperature was increased in steps of 50°C up to 700°C. During these thermal cycles, the sheet resistance was measured with a FPP from the top side of the test structure. In the analysis of these measurements, the sheet resistance at 150°C was considered to prevent any intrinsic influence of the temperature dependence of the Cu, TaN, TiN, and Si resistivity. The stacks for the XRD measurements were annealed using a slightly different procedure, each stack was individually heated up to the anneal temperature at a ramp rate of 5°C/min and kept at this temperature for 30 min, after which they were slowly cooled inside the furnace.</p><p>For the Li diffusion barrier test, cyclic voltammetry was conducted with an Autolab PGSTAT30 ͑Ecochemie B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands͒ and galvanostatic cycling was performed using a M4300 galvanostat ͑Maccor, Tulsa, USA͒. The procedure used was identical to the one described by Baggetto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> An n-type silicon wafer ͑Sb-doped, resistivity of 8-22 m⍀ cm͒ was used as a substrate to facilitate the electrical connection to the barrier layer. The substrate had a native oxide surface.</p></div>

Both TiN and TaN show a linear increase in thickness with the number of cycles.</p><p>The TiN properties showed almost no dependence on the plasma exposure time, only a slight decrease in Cl content and decrease in resistivity was observed for longer plasma exposures. The TiN films investigated had an ͓N͔/͓Ti͔ ratio of 0.93 Ϯ 0.02 and all contained a relatively low level of impurities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> This is in agreement with previous work where the combination of TiCl 4 and H 2 -N 2 plasma showed excellent material properties compared to other ALD TiN processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Note that, for the Cu diffusion barrier experiments, slightly different deposition conditions were used ͑400°C substrate temperature and a 500 W plasma with a H 2 -N 2 ͑60-8 sccm͒ gas mixture͒, which resulted in a slight increase in growth rate and resistivity.</p><p>The TaN properties depend strongly on the plasma exposure time. This can be explained by the fact that TaN can exist in many crystal phases, depending on the ͓Ta͔/͓N͔ ratio. Stable crystal phases ranging from conductive Ta 2 N to semiconductive Ta 3 N 5 have been reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> The TaN films obtained with a 3 s H 2 plasma were reasonably conductive ͑3400 ⍀ cm͒, had a relatively low N content of 32%, and had the cubic crystal phase ͑see below͒. The N content further reduced down to 25% when the plasma exposure time was increased, which also resulted in a higher mass density and lower resistivity ͑as low as 380 ⍀ cm, Table <ref type="table">II͒</ref>. H 2 -N 2 mixtures and NH 3 were also used as the plasma gasses, but these conditions resulted in a large increase in resistivity ͑e.g., 1.1 ϫ 10 4 ⍀ cm for a 98:2 H 2 -N 2 plasma͒ and even led to the semiconducting Ta 3 N 5 phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Because our interest lies in conductive barrier films, only films deposited by H 2 plasma were investigated in the current work.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref> show the growth per cycle and FPP resistivity of the films as a function of plasma exposure time. During the first few seconds of plasma exposure, both processes show a large increase in the growth per cycle after which saturation takes place. For TaN a so-called soft saturation behavior is observed while the saturation in growth per cycle is much clearer for the TiN case. This soft saturation can be explained by the aforementioned dependence of the material properties on the plasma exposure time ͑see Table <ref type="table">II͒</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> The change in material properties for TaN is also evident by the large change in resistivity with plasma exposure time ͑Fig. 3b͒. For TiN, only minor changes take place that can be attributed to a small reduction in the Cl-impurity content.</p><p>The microstructure of the films was investigated by XRD and the measured spectra for TaN and TiN films deposited under the baseline conditions of Table I are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. For both films, it is clear that the material has a cubic phase structure as can be concluded from the comparison to the powder sample data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> Both the TaN and TiN films show a strong preferential ͑200͒ growth direction compared to the powder sample. Fréty et al. found that sputtered TaN also showed a preferential ͑200͒ growth direction depending on the N 2 pressure during deposition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> For a TaN film of 800 cycles deposited using H 2 plasma and Ta͓N͑CH 3 ͒ 2 ͔ 5 precursor, Kim et al. found no preferential direction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> while Park et al. reported an increase of the ͑200͒ peak intensity using longer plasma exposures and</p><p>Table II.

Evidently, a higher failure temperature indicates a higher barrier quality. Test structures were fabricated by sputter depositing Cu films onto the barrier layers as described in the experimental details. The TaN and TiN film were deposited on the Si substrates, where TaN was deposited using the baseline conditions ͑Table I͒, and the TiN film was deposited under slightly modified conditions ͑i.e., 400°C deposition temperature, 500 W plasma with 60 sccm H 2 and 8 sccm N 2 ͒. These conditions result in very similar material properties as shown for the baseline conditions ͑Table II͒.</p><p>For both barrier materials, two different experiments were carried out. First, the sheet resistance of a Cu-barrier-Si stack was monitored as a function of anneal temperature. Variation of Cu sheet resistance with anneal temperature is known to provide a good measure of barrier performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Barrier failure leads to a sig-nificant change in resistivity due to the formation of poorly conductive Cu 3 Si, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> which will result in an increase in the sheet resistance due to the concurrent loss of Cu. As a reference, the sheet resistance of a barrier-Si stack was also measured to find possible annealing effects and to investigate the thermal stability of the barrier material itself.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the sheet resistance at 150°C of the TaN-Si, TiN-Si, Cu-TaN-Si, and the Cu-TiN-Si stacks as a function of anneal temperature. The resistance of the TaN-Si stack decreases for temperatures of Ͼ400°C. The fact that this occurs at 400°C instead of just above the deposition temperature ͑225°C͒ demonstrates the thermal stability of the TaN. A similar but less pronounced annealing effect is visible for the TiN-Si stack possibly related to the higher deposition temperature of 400°C. Because of the Cu film, the Cu-TaN-Si and Cu-TiN-Si stacks show a very low sheet resistance ͑0.2 ⍀/ᮀ and 0.1 ⍀/ᮀ, respectively͒, which is lost for both barriers for annealing temperatures of Ͼ600°C, when the sheet resistance suddenly increases.</p><p>To attribute the change in sheet resistance with annealing to barrier failure or another effect, a second experiment was performed; XRD spectra were measured for the stacks after annealing at different temperatures. These spectra should reveal possible Cu 3 Si formation and the concurrent loss of Cu. For completeness, it should be noted that the XRD spectra for the annealed TaN and TiN films  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G290</head><p>Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 155 ͑12͒ G287-G294 ͑2008͒ G290 without a Cu layer ͑not shown͒ were indistinguishable from the original ͑not-annealed͒ film. This indicates that the reduction in resistivity of the TiN and TaN in the TiN-Si and TaN-Si stacks shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> is not caused by a measurable change in microstructure.</p><p>The XRD spectra for the Cu-TaN-Si stacks annealed at 200, 400, 600, 650, and 700°C are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. The most intense lines for the diffraction patterns of powder samples of cubic TaN, Cu, and Cu 3 Si are also indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Three observations can be made when comparing the XRD spectra: ͑i͒ the TaN lines are not affected by the anneal, ͑ii͒ the intensity of the Cu lines drops for the samples annealed at 650 and 700°C, and, most importantly, ͑iii͒ Cu 3 Si lines appear for the samples annealed above 600°C. These Cu 3 Si lines are best visible at 2 values of 65 and 82°. These observations are therefore in agreement with the result obtained by the sheet resistance measurements ͑i.e., between 600 and 650°C Cu starts diffusing through the TaN film and the barrier fails͒.</p><p>For sputtered TaN films ranging from 25 to 50 nm thick, it has been reported that Cu diffusion starts between 650 and 700°C, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> where the rate of diffusion is lower for films with higher N content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Kim et al. reported a failure temperature of 800°C for a 12 nm thick TaN 0.75-0.8 film deposited by ALD using a 5 s H 2 plasma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> The same group also reported that similar to sputtered barrier films an increase in N content further increases the failure temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> However, it should also be noted that increasing the N content of the TaN film increases the resistivity, which can be undesirable in barrier applications. Our results are in qualitative agreement with those reported in literature, considering the fact that a lower failure temperature ͑600-650°C͒ was observed for TaN films with lower N content ͑TaN 0.49 , Table <ref type="table">II͒</ref>. Moreover, a difference in microstructure can also have a large effect on failure temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> We observed a preferential ͑200͒ growth direction while Kim et al. did not report such a preferential growth direction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> This is a factor that likely contributes to the difference in failure temperature because a strong preferential growth can be related to a columnar microstructure, which gives rise to fast diffusion pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The XRD spectra for the Cu-TiN-Si stacks annealed at 200, 400, 600, and 700°C are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. The most intense lines for the diffraction patterns of powder samples of cubic TiN, Cu, and Cu 3 Si are also indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. Two conclusions can be drawn when comparing the XRD spectra: the TiN lines are not affected by the anneal and the Cu lines become more intense and narrower for higher anneal temperatures. Most importantly, no Cu 3 Si lines are observed, which points to no barrier failure up to a temperature of 700°C.</p><p>To further investigate the evolution of the Cu in the stack with anneal temperature for both the Cu-TaN-Si and Cu-TiN-Si stacks, the intensity of the strong Cu͑111͒ peak ͑2 43.3°͒ was determined and the crystallite size was obtained from the full width at half maximum of this peak using Scherrer's equation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref> show the intensity and the crystallite size vs anneal temperature for Cu͑111͒ in the Cu-TaN-Si and Cu-TiN-Si stacks, respectively. The Cu peak intensity shows an increase with anneal temperature for both TaN and TiN up to 600°C, indicating Cu crystallization. The Cu crystallization is in agreement with the FPP results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, showing a small decrease in resistance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G291</head><p>Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 155 ͑12͒ G287-G294 ͑2008͒ G291</p><p>TaN-Si stack shows a strong decrease as also expected from the Cu 3 Si peak appearance and the strong increase in sheet resistance. A completely different behavior is observed for Cu in the Cu-TiN-Si stack. The intensity increases strongly while the crystallite size also increases slightly, especially for a temperature of Ͼ600°C. This suggests a strong crystallization behavior that can be related to high bulk diffusion inside the Cu above 600°C due to its low melting point ͑1085°C͒.</p><p>Because no Cu 3 Si peaks are formed and the Cu peak intensity is not decreasing for the Cu-TiN-Si stack, the increase in sheet resistance for temperatures of Ͼ600°C in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> cannot be explained by the loss of Cu. Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows scanning electron microscope ͑SEM͒ images of the surface of the Cu-TiN-Si stack: the as-deposited film ͑Fig. 9a͒ shows a smooth surface compared to the annealed ͑700°C͒ Cu surface ͑Fig. 9b͒, which reveals a clear roughening of the Cu film. Annealing is reported to cause roughening of Cu films on poorly wettable surfaces such as TiN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> When a larger area is observed ͑30 m width, Fig. <ref type="figure">9c͒</ref>, a discontinuous Cu film is visible. The discontinuous Cu film explains why the resistance increases for temperatures of Ͼ600°C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Because of the large crystallite growth above 600°C, poorly connected islands are formed, resulting in an increase in sheet resistance. Apparently the 50 nm Cu film is not thick enough to prevent this effect. Contrary to TiN, Ta-rich TaN, which is used for the Cu-TaN-Si stacks, has been reported to have excellent wettability for Cu. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> For TiN, the resistance increase is therefore not caused by Cu diffusion through the barrier, suggesting excellent barrier properties. A method to improve the wettability of TiN by surface treatments will be reported in a future publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> For stacks with 25 nm of sputtered TiN, failure temperatures were reported ranging from Ͼ550 to Ͼ750°C for increasing TiN mass density ͑4.99-5.12 g cm -3 ͒. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> It is interesting to note that the density of the films in our work is lower ͑4.0 g cm <ref type="bibr">-3</ref> , Table <ref type="table">II͒</ref> while the barrier properties are still good up to 700°C. Uhm and Jeon reported a resistance increase using FPP measurements at temperatures above 600°C, Cu 3 Si peaks in XRD spectra at 550°C, and small defects using an etch pit test at 500°C for ALD TiN films deposited at 450°C using TiCl 4 and NH 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Comparing these failure temperatures to our results indicate excellent barrier properties for the TiN films deposited by remote plasma ALD.</p><p>Li diffusion barrier properties.-In 3D integrated all-solid-state batteries, the barrier layers must prevent diffusion of Li from the active battery layers into the substrate over the entire electrochemical potential range used. A thin barrier layer is desired ͑10-100 nm͒ while maintaining the barrier properties and sufficient electrical conduction. Baggetto et al. reported the feasibility of using sputtered TaN and TiN films as planar Li diffusion barriers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> To assess the prospects of using high aspect ratio ͑Ͼ5͒ structures in future 3D batteries, TaN and TiN films deposited with ALD were investigated in this work.</p><p>To do so, the electrochemical properties of 60 nm thick planar TiN and TaN films deposited by remote plasma ALD under the baseline conditions were studied ͑see Table I and II͒. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> shows cyclic voltammograms of the films measured in a Licontaining electrolyte solution under the experimental conditions as described by Baggetto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The TiN film shows a very low current over the entire potential range, indicating low reactivity toward Li and demonstrating its capability as Li diffusion barrier. The reactivity of the TaN film is much higher than that of the TiN film, as indicated by the intensity of the current peaks at ϳ1 and 1.5 V. These peaks can be ascribed to tantalate structures, such as Ta 2 O 5 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> which are known to be active intercalation materials below 1.5 V. As can be seen from the atomic composition ͑Table II͒, a significant fraction of oxygen is present in the TaN films. When the TaN film is exposed to cycles of constant-current charging and discharging, an experiment that provides information about the amount of charge involved during continuous cycling, an intercalation response into silicon is observed after a few cycles ͑not presented here͒. This response means that the actual TaN films do not prevent the penetration of Li ions into the bulk of silicon. For the TiN film, the barrier performs well under this galvanostatic cycling and it has an even lower Li intercalation capacity than a 70 nm thick sputtered TiN film as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>.</p><p>Obviously, for the TaN film, the reactivity toward Li is too high. However, because TaN can have a wide range of compositions, tuning the composition might provide adequate barrier properties for certain TaN films deposited by ALD. From the current results, it is already clear that TiN deposited by remote plasma ALD is a very promising candidate for Li diffusion barrier applications. For sputtered films, TiN also showed better characteristics than TaN, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> while the ALD grown TiN films exhibit an even lower Li capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Remote plasma ALD of TaN and TiN films has been investigated using the combinations of Ta͓N͑CH 3 ͒ 2 ͔ 5 precursor with H 2 plasma and TiCl 4 precursor with H 2 -N 2 plasma, respectively. Cubic metal nitride films with a relatively low electrical resistivity ͑TaN: 380 ⍀ cm; TiN: 150 ⍀ cm͒ can be deposited for both materials with the properties of the TaN material strongly depending on the plasma exposure time.</p><p>Furthermore, diffusion barrier tests have been carried out with respect to the anticipated application of the materials as Cu and Li diffusion barriers. TaN films show a good Cu barrier performance up to 600°C, as found by FPP and XRD experiments. For TiN films, no Cu diffusion was observed up to a temperature of 700°C. However, (a) </p></div>

Consequently, both Cu and Li diffusion barrier experiments indicate better barrier properties for the TiN films, suggesting that the TiN films prepared by remote plasma ALD yields an overall better barrier performance than the TaN films prepared by remote plasma ALD. Although it is unclear for the moment whether the difference in Cu barrier performance is an intrinsic material property or due to the difference in process conditions used ͑such as halide precursor at high substrate temperature of 400°C for TiN and metallorganic precursor at lower substrate temperature of 225°C for TaN͒, future work will focus on TiN addressing its barrier properties when deposited in high aspect ratio structures required for future 3D-SiP devices.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. ͑Color online͒ ͑a͒ A schematic overview of the basic configuration of the remote plasma ALD reactors.
