The chart illustrates the integrated intensity of OES signals at different wavelengths (777 nm - O*, 656 nm - H*, 519 nm - CO*) as a function of the number of Al(CH₃)₃ experiments per cycle. The intensity increases with the number of cycles for all wavelengths, reaching saturation levels around 10 cycles.
