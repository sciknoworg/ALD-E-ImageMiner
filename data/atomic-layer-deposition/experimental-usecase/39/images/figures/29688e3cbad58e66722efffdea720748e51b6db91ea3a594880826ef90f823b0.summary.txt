The diagram illustrates a setup for a chemical reaction involving Al(CH₃)₃, where various analytical instruments are used to monitor the process. The system includes a quartz tube with an rf coil for heating, a spectroscopic ellipsometer for optical measurements, a quartz crystal microbalance for mass changes, a mass spectrometer for gas analysis, and a turbo pump for gas removal. The reaction takes place in a trapped volume, and the process is monitored over cycles.
