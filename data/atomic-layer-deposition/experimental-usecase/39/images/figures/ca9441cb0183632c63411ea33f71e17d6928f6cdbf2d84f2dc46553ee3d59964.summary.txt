The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the number of Al(CH3)3 experiments per cycle and the growth rate (Å/cycle) and mass gain (Hz) measured by QCM at two different temperatures (70°C and 200°C). The data points show that the growth rate increases with the number of experiments up to a certain point, after which it plateaus. The mass gain remains relatively constant across the number of experiments.
