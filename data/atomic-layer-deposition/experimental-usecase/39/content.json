        "text": "Plasma- assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) of metal oxide films is increasingly gaining interest, however, the underlying reaction mechanisms have rarely been addressed. In this work, a case study is presented for the plasma- assisted ALD process of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  based on  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  dosing and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma exposure. A complementary set of time- resolved in situ diagnostics was employed, including spectroscopic ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance, mass spectrometry, and optical emission spectroscopy. The saturation of the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  adsorption reactions was investigated, as well as the reaction products created during both the precursor dosing and the plasma exposure step. The generality of the observations was cross- checked on a second commercial ALD reactor. The main observations are as follows: (i) during the precursor dosing, the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  predominantly binds bifunctionally to the surface at  $70^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  through a reaction in which  $\\mathrm{H}$  is abstracted from the surface and  $\\mathrm{CH_4}$  is released into the gas phase; (ii) during the plasma exposure, O radicals in the plasma are consumed at the surface by combustionlike reactions with the surface  $- \\mathrm{CH}_3$  ligands, producing mainly  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ ,  $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ , and  $\\mathrm{CO}$ ; (iii) small gas phase densities of  $\\mathrm{CH_4}$  and higher hydrocarbons  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_x)$  are also present during the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma exposure step indicating complementary surface reactions including a secondary thermal ALD- like reaction by the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  produced at the surface; (iv) the plasma and its optical emission are strongly affected by the surface reaction products released in the plasma. In the latter respect, optical emission spectroscopy proved to be a valuable tool to study the surface reaction products during the plasma exposure as well as the saturation of the surface reactions. The implications of the experimental observations are addressed and it is discussed that the reaction mechanisms are generic for plasma- assisted ALD processes based on metal organic precursors and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma as oxidant source.

        "text": "The synthesis of very thin metal oxide films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is currently a very active research field. Investigations into various metal oxide materials for applications in semiconductor devices such as gate oxide in complementary- metal- oxide- semiconductor gate stacks and as dielectric layer in dynamic- random- access- memory devices had led to a rapid increase in the number of ALD processes developed. In many of the metal oxide ALD processes metal organic precursors are employed and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  is used as oxidant. However, since recently, ALD processes in which  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  or an  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma is used as an alternative oxidant source are gaining increasingly more attention. In these latter processes the oxidant is more reactive than  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  and, therefore, the surface reactions rely less on thermal activation by the substrate temperature. For example, when an  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma is used, chemical activation of the oxidant has already occurred in the gas phase and, therefore, the use of a lower deposition temperature is in many cases facilitated. Furthermore, for some materials it has been reported that improved film properties are obtained when using  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  or  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma instead of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ . The potentially more favorable process settings (e.g., in terms of substrate temperature and purge times) as well as the potentially improved material properties obtained for the  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma based ALD processes have also contributed to an increased interest into ALD by other fields of technology than semiconductor industry. Potential application of ALD films in areas such as microsystems, solar cells, flexible electronics, energy storage, and photonics have recently been reported.",

Nonetheless, the oxidation step by the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma appeared to be very different from the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  based process. It was demonstrated that combustion- like reactions by the plasma generated  $\\mathrm{O}$  radicals removed the  $- \\mathrm{CH}_3$  ligands from the surface because combustion products such as  $\\mathrm{CO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  were detected by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, a small signal due to the presence of  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$  during the plasma exposure step indicated that the formed  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  byproduct induces a secondary thermal ALD- like reaction pathway. Previously such secondary reaction pathway, in which the reaction products of the oxidation step play a role in the surface chemistry, was speculated upon. In this article we present corroborating evidence and additional details that support the previously proposed reaction mechanism. A more extensive and complementary data set is reported as obtained by a combination of several in situ diagnostics such as spectroscopic ellipsometry (SEM, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements, quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). More specifically, extensive data on the saturation of the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  chemisorption reaction are presented. The previous observations are also corroborated by an additional data set obtained on a commercial  $200\\mathrm{mm}$  ALD reactor (Oxford Instruments FlexAL). More insight into several aspects of the reaction mechanism of plasma- assisted ALD of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  has been obtained: QMS signals for mass- to- charge ratios of  $m / z$ $= 24 - 30$  suggest the presence of small amounts of  $\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_x$  during the plasma exposure, in addition to the earlier detected presence of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ ,  $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ ,  $\\mathrm{CO}$ , and  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$ . By OES with an extended wavelength range in the UV, the presence of  $\\mathrm{OH}^*$  emission was also identified during the plasma step. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the saturation conditions for  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  film growth can be determined not only directly via the use of film growth monitoring techniques, such as spectroscopic ellipsometry and quartz crystal microbalance, but also indirectly by gas phase diagnostics, such as OES and QMS. On the basis of the results reported a more complete picture of the reaction mechanisms during plasma- assisted ALD of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  will be presented. Finally, from this case study of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ , the implications for plasma- assisted ALD of other metal oxide films grown from metal organic precursors and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma will be briefly discussed.",

At the moment when the plasma is switched on, a sharp downward spike in the signal can be observed. Different from thermal ALD, the occurrence of electrical charging by the presence of ions and electrons or possibly plasma induced heat transfer apparently interferes with a proper measurement during the plasma exposure. The spike is a true plasma artifact, corroborated by the fact that a similar spike is also observed when only the plasma is pulsed [i.e., no  $\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3$  dose has preceded the plasma exposure], as is presented in Fig. 5(b). In both cases the signal slowly recovers to its genuine level after the plasma is switched off  $(\\sim 20\\mathrm{s})$ .

        "text": "The gas phase species were also monitored by QMS for ALD cycles which included the use of 15 successive  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures. In Fig. 7 the QMS signals for the mass- to- charge ratios of  $m / z = 15$ $(\\mathrm{CH}_3^+)$  and  $m / z = 27$ $(\\mathrm{Al}^{+})$  are shown. The ratio  $m / z = 27$  can be attributed to the cracking of  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  in the mass spectrometer, whereas  $m / z = 15$  can be attributed to cracking of both  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  and  $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ . Simultaneously, QCM measurements were carried out to monitor film growth as shown in Fig. 7(c). In this part of the figure the precursor dosing and plasma exposure have also been indicated. Unfortunately, already during the recovery of the QCM signal from the plasma induced artifact, the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  dosing was started, which partly obscured the mass uptake. Still the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposure can be observed as a sharp increase in mass uptake in Fig. 7(c). The recovery of the signal from the plasma interference continues during the subsequent exposures of the precursor. It is evident that the mass uptake by QCM is accompanied by a sharp peak in the  $\\mathrm{CH_3}^+$  signal which is considerably higher for the first few  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures [see Fig. 7(a)]. Since no signal for  $\\mathrm{Al}^+$  is observed during these first few exposures, we can attribute the first few peaks in  $\\mathrm{CH_3}^+$  signal to the cracking of  $\\mathrm{CH_4}$  generated by the chemisorption of  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  on the surface, as reported above. The peak intensities of the  $\\mathrm{CH_3}^+$  signal gradually decreases with the number of  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures since less and less precursor chemisorps with each succeeding  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposure. After five to six  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures the  $\\mathrm{CH_3}^+$  peaks reach approximately a constant intensity at each additional exposure, whereas also a signal for  $\\mathrm{Al}^+$  is now observed in the QMS data [see Fig. 7(b)]. For the remainder of  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures, the  $\\mathrm{Al}^+$  and  $\\mathrm{CH_3}^+$  signal intensities have roughly the same peak height and both signals correlate to the dissociation of unreacted  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  in the QMS. Also after five to six  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures no more mass uptake is observed with the QCM [see Fig. 7(c)], indicating that the surface reactions have reached saturation. These observations agree well with the growth rate saturation curves obtained by SE and QCM shown in Fig. 3. Since QMS is a volume based technique, the aforementioned observations indicate that all surfaces, i.e., not only the surface of the QCM crystal or the substrate, but also the reactor walls, are saturatively covered with  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  precursor after five to six successive  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures. The measurements in Fig. 7 also indicate that the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  introduced into the reactor is fully consumed by the surface reactions for the first five to six  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures. Only when the surface reactions have saturated a significant density of  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  can build up in the gas phase leading to a QMS signal.",

The production of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  during the plasma exposure cannot be distinguished at  $m / z = 18$ . The absence of a clear signal rise at  $m / z = 18$  can be attributed to the relatively high pressure and therefore high background signal in the QMS on the FlexAL reactor in comparison with the QMS on the ALD- I reactor. The background signal at  $m / z = 18$  is approximately a factor of 10 higher in Fig. 11 than in Fig. 6, while the signal at  $m / z = 32$  due to the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  injected is quite comparable for the FlexAL and ALD- I. The signal at  $m / z = 32$  is only slightly higher in the FlexAL due to the higher operating pressure in the reactor (15 mTorr instead of 7.5 mTorr). The higher background pressure due to residual gases in the QMS and the corresponding higher baseline signal for  $m / z = 18$ $(\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}^+$  due to residual  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  prevent therefore the detection of the relatively small  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  levels generated during the plasma exposure step. A factor contributing to the higher  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  pressure and background  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  signal could be the lower wall temperature used in the experiments on the FlexAL reactor compared to the ALD- I reactor. This lower wall temperature will complicate efficient pumping of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  produced in the combustionlike reactions given the short cycle time of  $7.5\\mathrm{s}$ . This will lead to a built up to a relatively high  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  background pressure in the reactor and mass spectrometer. Although a clear  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  signal rise is absent during the plasma exposure, an increase at  $m / z = 15$  is still clearly observed providing evidence that the concurrent thermal ALD- like reactions are taking place in addition to the combustionlike reactions. This is an indirect indication of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  production during the plasma exposure step. Furthermore, similar as in the experiments on the ALD- I reactor a mass scan of  $m / z = 20 - 30$  in the FlexAL revealed the presence of small amounts of larger hydrocarbons  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_x)$  during the plasma exposure as shown in Fig. 12. Compared to the  $\\mathrm{CH}_4^+$  and  $\\mathrm{CO}^+$  signals during the plasma exposure step, the signals due to the higher hydrocarbons were approximately ten times lower in magnitude (ion current of  $\\sim 3\\times 10^{- 12}$  A). Similar to the case of the ALD- I setup (see Sec. III C), it can be inferred from this data that the production of these higher hydrocarbons is a minor effect.",

        "text": "The oxidation step during plasma- assisted ALD is very different from the oxidation step during thermal ALD with  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ . Oxygen radicals are the dominant species in an (inductively coupled)  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma and therefore rule the surface reactions during the oxidation step. These O radicals are consumed in the oxidation of the Al atoms on the surface and the combustion of the  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  surface groups. This consumption of O radicals leads to a change in the mass balance in the plasma, decreasing the O and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  density levels during the time interval that the surface reactions take place. The reaction of the O radicals with the  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  surface groups leads to several reaction products. Most important is the combustion of the  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  surface groups leading to CO,  $\\mathrm{CO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  reaction products in the gas phase. The fact that CO is observed in the plasma can indicate incomplete combustion reaction, however, from the data reported CO production from incomplete combustion cannot be distinguished unambiguously from the production of CO in the gas phase by dissociation of  $\\mathrm{CO}_2$  molecules in the plasma. This latter reaction will certainly also take place. A second reaction pathway during the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma step is initiated by the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  produced by the combustionlike reactions. Once  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  is produced from a  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  surface group it can react with a neighboring  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  surface group by a thermal ALD- like reaction. This secondary reaction competes therefore with the combustionlike reactions but it can only take place during the time when there are still  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  groups present at the surface. This reaction pathway becomes insignificant at the moment when almost all  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  surface groups are reacted away by the combustionlike reactions. A third reaction pathway is indicated by the observation of higher hydrocarbon species  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_x)$  in the plasma. The observation of such higher hydrocarbons suggests that the oxygen radicals are not effective in combusting all  $\\mathrm{- CH_3}$  surface groups. Consequently, it makes it more plausible that the combustionlike surface reactions are incomplete and that CO is also directly produced at the surface. The production of higher hydrocarbon species appears to be a minor effect, however, some of the higher hydrocarbon species can also be oxidized by combustionlike reactions with oxygen species in the gas phase. The higher hydrocarbon species can be generated at the surface by reaction mechanisms as proposed by Elliott et al. When O radicals attack the bonds within the  $\\mathrm{- Al - CH_3}$  surface groups, intermediate surface groups can be formed such as  $\\mathrm{- Al - O - CH_3}$  (methoxy groups) or  $\\mathrm{- Al - CH_2OH}$ . Subsequently, volatile higher hydrocarbon species  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_x)$  can be formed. For example, by association reactions between neighboring  $\\mathrm{- CH_2}$  surface groups, ethene  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_4)$  can be formed. On the basis of first principles density functional theory calculations it has been found that such reaction pathways might be energetically favored over combustionlike reactions. It should, however, be noted that the preference for certain surface reaction pathways is also determined by the flux of the incoming O radicals. During the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma exposure there is a relatively high flux of O radicals to the surface, which can cause the combustionlike reactions to be favored.",

During the precursor dosing, the chemisorption reactions are expected to specifically depend on the precursor, most notably on the nature of its organic ligands.
