To ensure  $(\\mathrm{Ag},\\mathrm{Cu})(\\mathrm{In},\\mathrm{Ga})\\mathrm{Se}_2$  (ACIGS) solar cell compatibility, a  $120^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ALD process was developed for  $\\mathrm{GeO}_y$  using  $\\mathrm{Ge(N(CH_3)_2)_4}$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as precursors. In the ALD supercycle approach, the  $\\mathrm{GeO}_y$  ALD cycle was interchanged with either  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  or  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  cycles to deposit TGO and ZGO with varying conduction band positions  $(E_c)$ , respectively. The material properties were experimentally verified using X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical absorption and by employing these films as ESLs in ACIGS solar cells. There, the open- circuit voltage initially increased as the Ge content of the TGO and ZGO films increased due to the ESL  $E_c$  simultaneously shifting up from the low position in  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  or  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  to match the ACIGS  $E_c$ . As the Ge content increased further, the fill factor (FF) of these devices decreased since the ESL  $E_c$  became positioned significantly above the ACIGS  $E_c$ , forming an energy barrier as seen from ACIGS. As a result, the efficiency of the ACIGS solar cell peaked for an intermediate Ge content for both TGO and ZGO. Using good TGO and ZGO compositions in ACIGS solar cells gave efficiencies of up to 14.8 and  $17.0\\%$ , respectively, which were lower than the reference best cell efficiencies of up to  $19.5\\%$  for CdS and  $18.2\\%$  for  $\\mathrm{Zn}_{1 - x}\\mathrm{Sn}_x\\mathrm{O}_y$  (ZTO). ZGO was, however, able to shift its  $E_c$  further up than ZTO, making it a potent ESL for high- band- gap absorbers. Based on the results, we listed a few key properties that are required for a good ACIGS solar cell ESL and gave a few suggestions on how they are linked to the previous success of ZTO.",

This trend appears almost as a linear combination of the lower GPC  $\\mathrm{GeO}_y$  subcycle and the larger GPC  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  subcycle. Both the trend in the cation ratio and the trend in GPC are also supported by QCM data (see the SI for details) and suggest that the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  and  $\\mathrm{GeO}_y$  subcycles affect each other only to a minor extent.

The GI- XRD diffractograms (Figure 4a) showed an amorphous morphology for the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  and TGO 0.30 films. It is not surprising to see that TGO 0.3 was both resistive and X- ray amorphous, given that its growth consists of subcycles of  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  and  $\\mathrm{GeO}_y$  that also share these properties. Similarly, the SEM cross- sectional micrographs of  $\\mathrm{ZnO:Al / }$ $\\mathrm{ZnO / TGO / ACIGS}$  stacks (Figure 7) showed no indication of crystallinity for  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  and TGO 0.10. As the films were amorphous, an indirect  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  model40 was used to determine the optical band gap of the TGO films (Figure 6a). Figure 6a and Table S2 show that the  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  slowly increased as the cation ratio increased. In contrast, the measured XPS  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  spectra (Figure 5a) were similar to large tails for all of the measured TGO films, even for the  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$ .

It cannot, however, be excluded that the  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  position may vary in the bulk of the samples. To facilitate the relative comparison between samples and exclude charging effects, the binding energy scale was aligned to the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon at  $285.0\\mathrm{eV}$ . This also resulted in an energy scale alignment of the shallow core levels for the TGO sample series. Assuming that the  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  of the surface is representable for the bulk and that the electronic and optical  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  are identical, the increasing  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  and the identical  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  position suggest that  $E_{\\mathrm{c}}$  shifts upward as the Ge content of the films increases.

Compared to the previous study using a high- temperature ALD process, the films in this study are similar in terms of being amorphous, showing tails in the optical absorption and an increasing  $E_{\\mathrm{c}}$  position with increasing Ge content, but are substantially more resistive. In the previous study, the resistivity was found to increase with increasing the Ge content as it reduced the O vacancies.

Increasing the Ge content further increased the resistivity until it exceeded the 4PP measurement range for the ZGO 0.26 film, where it was larger than  $0.45\\Omega \\mathrm{m}$  (Table S2). From GI- XRD, the low- Ge content ZGO films had wurtzite  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  peaks that gradually weakened as the amount of Ge was increased (Figure 4b). Increasing the Ge content further gave X- ray amorphous films. The SEM micrographs (Figure 7) of  $\\mathrm{ZnO:Al / ZnO / ZGO / }$  ACIGS stacks showed a similar trend in terms of the observed crystallinity of the ZGO film. For  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$ , it was hard to make out where the ESL ends and the sputtered  $\\mathrm{ZnO:Al / ZnO}$  stack begins. ZGO 0.12 showed distinct but smaller crystal grains compared to the  $\\mathrm{ZnO:Al / ZnO}$  stack, whereas ZGO 0.30 showed no obvious crystal grains. While the low- cation- ratio ZGO films likely have direct  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$ , there was a transition toward X- ray amorphous films for higher cation ratios, which are likely to give them indirect  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$ . For simplicity, all of the  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  values of ZGO were therefore estimated using an indirect  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  model. Using the indirect model, Figure 6b and Table S2 clearly show that  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  increased as the ZGO cation ratio increased. The crystallinity, resistivity, and  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  trends were all consistent with two recent publications on ZGO synthesis by ALD using different precursors and by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  was found to be able to incorporate small amounts of Ge into the wurtzite lattice and thereby increase both conductivity and  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$ , while larger amounts led to a high resistivity and worse crystal quality. One noticeable difference compared to these earlier studies is that these material property trends occur at higher Ge contents in our study. However, both the aforementioned ALD study and a sputter study on  $\\mathrm{ZGO}^{42}$  showed that the growth conditions such as deposition temperature had high influence on the morphology and electron affinity of the resulting ZGO films. The measured XPS  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  spectra indicated small differences between the ZGO sample series with the addition of Ge (Figure 5b). Similar to the TGO sample series, the binding energy scale has been aligned to the C 1s peak at  $285\\mathrm{eV}$  to facilitate comparison between the samples and to exclude any charging effects. Increasing the Ge content, the  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  at the surface of the samples seems to shift slightly toward higher binding energies. While this shift was not observed for the previously CVD grown ZGO with increasing Ge content, we noticed that the  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  position for  $\\mathrm{GoO}_2$  is clearly shifted away from  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  in this study and we did thus not find it unreasonable that  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  for the intermediate ZGO films would be positioned in between. Assuming that  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  does not vary too much in the bulk versus the near- surface region of the films and that the electronic and optical  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  s are identical, we can compare the  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  results to the optical measurements, as shown in Figure 6b. The  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  increase observed with increasing Ge content is comparable to the measured shift in  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$ . However, it becomes larger for higher Ge contents, suggesting that the  $E_{\\mathrm{c}}$  shifts upward. Figure 8b shows a schematic summary of the suggested band shifts. Their positions as a function of the Ge content and with regard to ACIGS are roughly estimated based on the measured optical  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  and the measured XPS  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  shifts of this study and the previously measured band positions of the  $\\mathrm{ZnO / CIGS}$  interface and ACIGS (eqs S3 and S4). Similarly, for TGO, the ZGO sample set also shows interesting correlations between different sample properties. At low Ge contents, the ZGO films are polycrystalline, have well- defined optical absorption and XPS  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  spectra, and have measurable resistivity. As the Ge content increases and the films become less crystalline, they show increased tailing in optical absorption and XPS  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  spectra and increased resistivity.",

While the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  was similar for the TGO films, the EQE showed blue light absorption losses for CdS due to its low  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  of  $2.4 \\mathrm{eV}$ . There was also a difference between CdS and TGO films for the position of the interference oscillations due to different  $\\mathrm{ZnO:Al / ZnO / ESL}$  stack thicknesses. Comparing the dark  $JV$  to the light  $JV$  (Figure S6a) for this sample set, the cation ratios up to TGO 0.10 showed no crossover. The TGO 0.16 sample showed both crossover and a kink that was only apparent in light  $JV$ . Curiously, TGO 0.30 appeared to have a light sensitive breakdown voltage. In the logarithmic scale (Figure S6b), all of the TGO ESLs up to 0.16 had similar steepest slopes but not as steep as the CdS reference. When trying to fit these curves to a single diode model, only the devices without kinks, thus the ones with low Ge contents, gave reasonable fits. For these devices, the ideality factor  $(n)$ , the saturation current density  $(J_{0})$ , and the series resistance  $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$  were found to be larger and the parallel resistance  $(R_{\\mathrm{p}})$  was found to be smaller compared to the CdS reference (Table S3). While the solar cell with CdS was still not ideal, the lower  $n$ ,  $J_{0}$ , and  $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$  and higher  $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$  can at least partially explain the superior  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and FF compared to the ones with TGO ESLs.",

        "text": "it stayed relatively constant afterward (Table 3 and Figures S7b and S8c). From EQE (Figure S3b), the lower  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  was due to a lower response from 330 up to approximately  $800~\\mathrm{nm}$ . Since it was lower for shorter wavelengths, electron- hole pairs generated close to the ESL/ACIGS interface must, to a larger extent, recombine prior to being collected at the contacts. This suggests that the ESL/ACIGS interface recombination was large. The EQE also showed that the interference peaks shifted to slightly different wavelengths, which was likely due to the varying ESL thickness (Table S2). Similarly, the CdS reference showed a different interference pattern and blue light loss due to its  $2.4\\mathrm{eV}E_{\\mathrm{g}}$ . While the resulting conversion efficiency (Table 3 and Figure S8d) was somewhat affected by  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  at lower Ge contents, it was mostly defined by the  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}\\times \\mathrm{FF}$  product. The  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  x FF product and the efficiency peaked for the ZGO 0.32 ESL, where the FF had only decreased a bit and where the  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  was still increasing with the Ge content. While the ZGO 0.33 ESL in this case outperformed the reference CdS ESL with regard to solar cell efficiency, it is important to remember that the ACIGS surface of this series was not posttreated with RbF prior to the deposition of CdS or ZGO. It is worth noting that the spread in solar cell performance was larger when using a ZGO ESL instead of a TGO ESL (Tables 2 and 3; Figures S5 and S8). In the extreme case of the ZGO 0.37 ESL, the spread originated from fairly continuous trends in FF,  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ , and  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  across the sample, suggesting that the film did not have the same ZGO cation ratio for all cells. Perhaps this nonuniformity was related to the previously discussed inhibition issues of the ALD ZGO processes. The dark  $JV$  of this sample set (Figure S9a) did in general not show crossover with the light curves. An exception to this was ZGO 0.37, which showed a minor crossover at forward bias and a different light  $JV$  curvature at reverse bias compared to the dark  $JV$ . From the logscale of the dark  $JV$  (Figure S9b), it was apparent that the lower ZGO cation ratios gave larger saturation or even shunt currents. It is not unreasonable to think that these currents are facilitated through recombination sites at the ESL/ACIGS interface that were shown to be active in EQE. In general, the steepest slopes of the dark  $JV$  curves of the solar cells in this sample set were quite small and very similar between the different cation ratios, suggesting that they were fundamentally limited by similar recombination if the high saturation and shunt currents were excluded. While it was only possible to model the devices with intermediate Ge contents using a single diode model, they showed similar  $n$ ,  $J_{0}$ ,  $R_{\\mathrm{S}}$ , and  $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$  to the CdS references, confirming the dark  $JV$  observations. Perhaps this suggests that the lack of RbF treatment of this particular ACIGS absorber rather than the ESL choice imposed the upper limit for the solar cell performance of this sample set.",

        "text": "The volcano trends in  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and FF as the Ge content increases for TGO and ZGO ESLs resemble the results from the previous study on  $\\mathrm{ZGO}^{25}$  and the studies on  $\\mathrm{Zn(O,S)}$ $(\\mathrm{Zn},\\mathrm{Mg})\\mathrm{O},$  ZTO,  $\\mathrm{ZnIn}_x\\mathrm{S}_y,$  ZnTiO, TGAO, and  $\\mathrm{In}_2(\\mathrm{S},\\mathrm{O})_3$  ESLs with varying  $E_{c}$  positions on ACIGS absorbers.10- 13 The main theory for these trends has been that the ACIGS solar cells are very sensitive to the placement of the ESL  $E_{c}$  Placing it beneath the ACIGS  $E_{c}$  was proposed to increase the ESL/ACIGS interface recombination. This is due to the band bending of the ESL and the ACIGS that in general places the  $\\mathfrak{p} - \\mathfrak{n}$  junction directly at the ESL/ACIGS interface, thereby increasing the interface recombination probability. By shifting the  $E_{c}$  further up the band bending forces the  $\\mathfrak{p} - \\mathfrak{n}$  junction away from the ESL/ACIGS interface and into the ACIGS, thereby lowering the probability of interface recombination. In addition, as the ESL  $E_{c}$  shifts further up in energy, the resulting ESL band bending further prevents the diffusion of electrons directly from the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) to the ESL/ACIGS interface. The effectiveness of this depends on the ESL doping though, where higher doping not only increases the majority carriers within the ESL but also reduces the barrier for diffusion from the TCO. Perhaps this is why the low- resistivity ZGO films showed a lower  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and indications of a higher interface recombination in the EQE, light  $JV$ , and dark  $JV$  (Figures S6, S7, and S9) compared to the high- resistivity TGO films with similarly low  $E_{c}$  positions. In general, the effects of shifting  $E_{c}$  up mitigate the interface recombination and lead to an increased  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$ , which has previously been verified both experimentally and through modeling.10,14,43- 49 In this study, the XPS  $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$  spectra and the optically determined  $E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  suggested that the effective  $E_{c}$  shifts upward with increasing Ge content of ZGO and TGO (Figure 8). With this in mind, the solar cell results showed that  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  does, in general, increase as  $E_{c}$  shifts higher in the ZGO and TGO ESLs. Previous studies also showed that placing the ESL  $E_{c}$  above the ACIGS  $E_{c}$  created an energy barrier for the photoexcited electrons to traverse as they are extracted from the ACIGS. If the barrier becomes too high, larger than  $0.3\\mathrm{eV}$ , it was observed to induce a bias- dependent electron transfer across the interface, seen as a kink in the  $JV$  curve, and a reduced FF.10,14,43- 50 This injection barrier seen from the ACIGS to ESL is, however, dependent on band bending and effectively decreases when the doping of the ESL is high. A similar decrease in FF due to a kink in  $JV$  appeared in this study when using the TGO 0.16 or ZGO 0.37 ESL, suggesting that the effective  $E_{c}$  was shifted too high in these ESLs. Relating these ESL back to their roughly estimated band positions, shown as the point with FF loss in Figure 8, they do indeed create barriers toward the ACIGS. While this occurred for slightly different barrier heights according to Figure 8, it is important to remember that the band placements are estimates and that we do not know the effective barrier height as the doping of TGO 0.16 and ZGO 0.37 is not known. Shifting  $E_{c}$  even higher has been shown to enhance the kink, and in the extreme case, the energy barrier became so large that almost no electrons were able to cross the interface and leave the ACIGS, which vastly reduced the  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  and  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$ .19,44,47,49 This behavior was reproduced when TGO 0.30 was used, which was the ESL with the highest effective  $E_{c}$  of the TGO films (Figure 8). This sample also showed a vastly reduced dark current (Figure S6), suggesting that the barrier was so high that it hampers not only the injection from the ACIGS to the TCO but also the diffusion of electrons from the TGO to the ACIGS even at substantial forward bias. Due to the tradeoff between an increased  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and a lowered FF, previous studies have observed that the best performance was achieved when the ESL  $E_{c}$  was placed at the same level or slightly above the ACIGS  $E_{c}$ .10,43- 50 In this study, the best devices were found for the ZGO 0.32 and TGO 0.10 ESLs, both just after the onset of the FF losses. Thus, our observed trends in FF and  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  indicate that we successfully shifted and found good  $E_{c}$  positions for TGO and ZGO by varying their cation ratios.",

Prior to the  $JV$  sweeps, the solar cells were exposed to  $24~\\mathrm{h}$  of light soaking under 1 sun without active cooling to enhance their performance. $^{26,51}$  Despite having good  $E_{c}$  alignments, the solar cells with ZGO 0.32 and TGO 0.077 ESLs had lower FF and  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  compared to CdS (Table 4 and Figures 10a, S10, and S11). The solar cells with ZGO 0.32 ESLs had almost the same  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  as those with ZTO 0.2 but, on average, worse FF. There was however a large spread in FF across the sample for ZGO 0.32, perhaps relating back to the uniformity issues of the ALD process. The TGO 0.077 ESL clearly gave lower  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and FF compared to the Zn- or Cd- containing alternatives, just like in a previous study on TGAO ESL. $^{14}$  Aside from the blue losses in EQE for the devices with  $2.4\\mathrm{eV}E_{\\mathrm{g}}$  CdS, all of the solar cells showed good collection with some variation in the interference peak positions due to the difference in their  $\\mathrm{ZnO:Al / ZnO / ESL}$  stack thicknesses. This resulted in similar  $J_{\\mathrm{sc}}$  values for the different solar cells. There was no crossover between the dark and light  $JV$  for this sample set (Figure S12). The single- diode fit to the dark  $JV$  showed a correlation between having a low  $n$  and  $J_{0}$  and measuring a high  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  (Table S5). This confirms that  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and, to some extent, the FF are limited by ESL- related recombination, e.g., interface recombination. In general, there was not a strong correlation between the modeled  $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$  and  $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$  measured FF, suggesting that  $n$  was the limiting factor. However, the cells with TGO 0.077 and the worst FF of the set did clearly show both the highest  $n$  and  $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$  values. For the best cells using EQE- corrected current density, the performance was  $14.8\\%$  for TGO 0.077,  $17.0\\%$  for ZGO 0.32,  $18.2\\%$  for ZTO 0.2, and  $19.5\\%$  for CdS (Table 5). These results were in general in line with the average data, except for ZGO 0.32, which comes closer to ZTO 0.2 and CdS due to only selecting the best cell. As previously shown, it is not trivial to use ALD based ESLs on alkali halide- treated ACIGS surfaces, and they do, in general, come short of chemical bath- based alternatives, e.g., CdS, because of this. $^{32}$  However, previous studies also showed that the ability of the ALD ZTO ESL to shift its  $E_{c}$  up enables a higher  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  compared to CdS for absorbers where the  $E_{c}$  resides higher, e.g., ACIGS with high Ga content,  $\\mathrm{Cu(In,Ga)S_2}$ , and CZTS. $^{18 - 21}$  Even with the ZTO ESL, these solar cells still showed large  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  deficits, which was partially believed to be due to the ZTO not fully being able to push its  $E_{c}$  all the way up to match the absorber  $E_{c}$ . Therefore, it is very encouraging to see that ZGO, with its ability to shift  $E_{c}$  even further up, comes so close in performance to ZTO in this initial study.",

One thing that clearly distinguishes the TGO process from the more successful ALD ESL is that it does not contain Zn or its very reactive precursor DEZ. In the first test, the initial ALD conditions of Zn- containing ESLs were therefore mimicked by using three ALD cycles of ZnS (DEZ and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$ ) before continuing on with a TGO 0.077 ESL. The resulting  $JV$  data for these solar cells (Tables 4 and 5; Figures 10, S10, and S11) show that  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  improved to values comparable to using ZGO 0.32 ESL. Such an effect is in line with previous studies where thin ZnS interlayers at the ESL/CIGS interface improved  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  by lowering the recombination. $^{9,52}$  While not completely understood, some studies have suggested that Zn reacts with the surface and occupies Cu vacancies that are prevalent on these absorbers. This effectively dopes the surface n- type and has been suggested to push the p- n junction into the absorber and thus lower the influence of interface recombination. $^{53 - 55}$  To test if this  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  gain was exclusive to using a DEZ +  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  exposure of the ACIGS surface, a similar exposure test was performed with a single  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALD cycle  $\\mathrm{(Al(CH_3)_3}$  trimethylaluminum, TMA) and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ . The resulting  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  for these cells also became comparable to that for ZGO 0.32 (Tables 4 and 5; Figures 10, S10, and S11). While there are no studies suggesting a diffusion of Al into ACIGS, there are studies where such an exposure led to native surface oxides being converted into  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  that ends up passivating the interfaces by either removing recombination paths or by the inherent fixed charge of the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  repelling charge carriers away. $^{56 - 59}$  The  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  gain was thus not exclusive to using DEZ in the ALD process, but perhaps such pretreatments that electrically passivate the ACIGS surface before the TGO process starts growing or change the chemistry of the TGO film at the interface are required to form a good interface. The two pretreatments did, however, not improve the FF of the ACIGS solar cells (Figures S12a and S4b). This agrees with the single- diode fitting of the dark  $JV$ , where neither the  $n$  nor the  $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$  changes with the pretreatments (Table S5). Compared to the other solar cells of the series, the  $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$  was distinctly higher for all of the solar cells with TGO ESLs (Table S5). As",

However, when comparing solar cells with TGO 0.10 ESLs using 402 and 204 cycles (Figure S13), there is no difference in FF, suggesting that the bulk resistivity has a negligible effect. This is similar to what was previously observed for amorphous TGAO ESLs. An increased series resistance could also stem from having increased contact resistance at either the ESL/ACIGS or the ZnO/ESL interface. The contact resistance decreases with doping of the materials. While the bulk resistivities are high for both TGO and ZGO, it is possible that their doping levels vary, and that, e.g., it is low enough for TGO to increase the contact resistance to ACIGS and ZnO. It would therefore be interesting to further investigate whether other treatments of the ACIGS could also improve FF and whether treating the ESL prior to the ZnO deposition has an effect on FF.",

        "text": "From the results on ZGO and TGO ESLs, we are able to gain several insights into the previous success of ZGO and Zn- containing ALD ESLs in general. We note that the best solar cells using ZGO 0.32 ESLs give slightly lower  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and FF compared to ZTO ESLs, whereas solar cells with TGO ESLs fall short in these parameters. From this, we can deduce that an ALD process including Zn seems to be beneficial for the ACIGS and that the choice of the other cation, Sn or Ge in this case, seems less influential. The surface exposures of the ACIGS surface using  $\\mathrm{DEZ + H_2S}$  or TMA improves  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  for devices with TGO. This suggests that when DEZ or a precursor of similar reactivity, e.g., TMA, is used in the ALD process, the ESL/ACIGS interface quality is improved by the precursor exposure of the ACIGS surface during ESL film nucleation. Solar cells using ZGO ESLs are also able to achieve similar FF to those with ZTO 0.2, whereas the ones with TGO once more fall short, even after the aforementioned surface treatments. Based on the dark  $JV_{r}$  this seems to stem from an increased series resistance, and it aligns well with previous studies where TGAO falls short in FF due to a high series resistance and where  $(\\mathrm{Zn},\\mathrm{Mg})\\mathrm{O}$  and  $\\mathrm{Zn(O,S)}$  achieve similar performance to their CdS references. The fully amorphous nature of TGO and TGAO suggests that their bulk resistivity could be high, but it has been shown, both in this study for TGO and in a previous study on TGAO, that this is not what limits the FF. Instead, the previous study on TGAO suggested that the series resistance must stem from the interfaces to ACIGS and ZnO, which this study also finds to be a plausible cause for the low FF. In comparison, it seems that the Zn- containing processes are able to create low contact resistances to both the ACIGS and the ZnO window stack.",

        "text": "From these observations, we note three main criteria that need to be met for making good ESLs for ACIGS that the Zn- containing ESLs in general have: First, a good  $E_{c}$  alignment between the ESL and the absorber to minimize the influence of interface recombination and to avoid blocking excited electrons exiting the absorber; second, high interface quality between the ESL and ACIGS, which electrically passivates recombination paths there; and finally, the bulk of the ESL likely needs to form interfaces with low contact resistance toward the ACIGS and  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  to not affect the series resistance of the solar cell. In this study, we have shown that ZGO is able to decently fulfill all three of them, while TGO falls short of the latter two. It is however important to remember that the criteria are very dependent on the absorber material and that the TGO perhaps can work better if proper pretreatments of the underlying material and post- treatments of the TGO are performed to mitigate its issues with the latter two criteria.",

        "text": "An ALD process for  $\\mathrm{GeO}_y$  was developed at  $120^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  using TDMAGe and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ . The  $\\mathrm{GeO}_y$  process was then used to create ALD TGO and ZGO supercycle processes by mixing it with previously established  $\\mathrm{SnO}_y$  and  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  processes, respectively. By varying the Ge content of the ZGO and TGO films, their electrical, optical, and morphological properties changed. TGO remained highly resistive and amorphous for all Ge contents, whereas ZGO showed increased resistivity and reduced wurtzite crystallinity as the Ge content increased. The combined results from XPS and optical absorption suggested that the effective  $E_{c}$  shifts upward for both TGO and ZGO as the Ge content increased. This finding was tested for ACIGS solar cells, which are sensitive to the  $E_{c}$  alignment between the absorber and the ESL. For both TGO and ZGO, the general trend with increasing  $E_{c}$  was that  $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$  and thereby the solar cell efficiency increased. At some point, increasing the  $E_{c}$  position further up started to block electron transport from the absorber into the ESL, which decreased FF. The resulting solar cell efficiency as a function of the  $E_{c}$  shifting up resembled a volcano plot where the ESL from the peak region gave efficiency values of up to  $17.0\\%$  for ZGO 0.32 and  $14.8\\%$  for TGO  $0.077$ $19.5\\%$  CdS,  $18.2\\%$  ZTO). The promising performance of ZGO as an ESL in ACIGS solar cells, coupled with the ability to shift  $E_{c}$  higher than previously possible with ZTO, makes it very interesting to try out for related high-  $E_{c}$  absorbers such as  $\\mathrm{Cu_2ZnSb_4}$ ,  $\\mathrm{Cu_2ZnGeS_4}$ ,  $\\mathrm{Cu(In,Ga)S_2}$  and  $(\\mathrm{AgCu})\\mathrm{GaSe_2}$ . However, the ALD chemistry used in this study limited the growth rate and uniformity of the films. Thus, to fully use the potential of the high- Ge- content ZGO, a different ALD chemistry would need to be developed at this low deposition temperature or an alternative growth method would need to be used, such as CVD, pulsed laser deposition, or sputtering, which have previously shown promising results for  $\\mathrm{Cu}_2\\mathrm{O}$  and  $\\mathrm{BaSi}_2$  absorbers, respectively. In contrast, the TGO ALD process worked very well and there was no obvious hurdle to further increase the Ge content of the resulting films. While using these films as ESLs in ACIGS solar cells does not give the best performance, they are interesting ESL candidates for perovskite solar cells for several reasons. They do not contain Zn that reacts with the perovskite at the ESL/perovskite interface, they can change their  $E_{c}$  position in a wide range and thereby match a variety of perovskite  $E_{\\mathrm{o}}$  and they use a very similar ALD chemistry to  $\\mathrm{SnO}$ , that has already shown great success as an ESL in perovskite solar cells.",
