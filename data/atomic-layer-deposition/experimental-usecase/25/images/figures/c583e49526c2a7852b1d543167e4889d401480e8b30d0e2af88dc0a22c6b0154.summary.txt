The line chart displays the current density (in mA/cmÂ²) across different bias voltages (in V) for various materials including TGO 0.077, TGO 0.077 TMA, TGO 0.077 ZnS, ZGO 0.32, ZTO 0.20, and CdS. All materials show a similar trend where the current density increases sharply at higher positive biases.
