Such \"overconformality\" is indicative of the length of purging periods being insufficient for complete removal of excess precursor from the trench depth. The thickness uniformity is, however, adjustable by increasing the purge time between the precursor pulses.

The grains were well ordered, though showing distinguishable boundaries between ordered regions. The composition of interface layers is not exactly known and would require specific studies but, nevertheless, the existence of silicon- rich zirconium oxide layers between  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and Si should be considered.
