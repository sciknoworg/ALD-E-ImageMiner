The chart displays the capacitance (C) and dissipation (D) of two different ZrO2-based devices under varying bias voltages at three different frequencies (100 kHz, 500 kHz, and 1 MHz). The top chart corresponds to (CpMe)_2ZrMe_2/O_3 with a 13.1 nm thick ZrO2 layer, while the bottom chart corresponds to (CpMe)_2Zr(OMe)Me/O_3 with a 11.9 nm thick ZrO2 layer.
