The graph illustrates the growth rate of two different compounds ((CpMe)_2Zr(OMe)Me / O_3 and (CpMe)_2ZrMe_2 / O_3) as a function of deposition temperature. Both compounds show an increasing trend in growth rate with rising temperature, with the compound (CpMe)_2Zr(OMe)Me / O_3 consistently growing faster than (CpMe)_2ZrMe_2 / O_3 across all temperatures.
