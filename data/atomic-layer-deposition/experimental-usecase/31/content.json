From the compositional analysis by XPS for PE- ALD Co films prepared at lower growth temperatures than  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , it was found that the growth temperature is critical to obtain pure Co films without N incorporation. For example, at  $T_{\\mathrm{s}} = 250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , clear nitrogen XPS peak was detected. However, even for this sample, the resistivity was relatively low at  $51\\mu \\Omega \\mathrm{cm}$ , implying the nitrogen content is not very high.

Because PE- ALD using H plasma as a reactant also produced highly C- contaminated films, the existence of N is thought to be essential in obtaining high- purity Co films.

Almost the same results were obtained on Si. The growth rate vs  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  exposure time,  $t_{\\mathrm{s}}$ , shows apparent saturation at  $t_{\\mathrm{s}} = 1\\sim 3$  s range, but rapidly increases at longer exposure time. This indicates that the  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  absorption does not occur with good saturation. Also, as mentioned above, the ALD using  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  was found to produce highly carbon contaminated film with high resistivity even without reactant. These observations can be explained by low thermal stability of  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$ . The  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  is reported to be thermally decomposed at as low temperature as  $140^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . This low thermal stability is probably because the carbonyl ligand is easily removed from  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  by thermal energy. Thus, at  $T_{\\mathrm{s}} = 300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , the thermal decomposition of  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  leads to highly carbon contaminated films without reactant. Note that Co precursor with carbonyl ligand, for example  $\\mathrm{Co_2(CO)_8}$ , would not be a proper precursor for ALD of Co, as the thermal decomposition is expected to occur at low temperature and no self- saturation is expected. Note also that even with this low thermal stability, there is a limited self- saturation region between 1- 3 s. This should be related to the existence of  $\\mathrm{Cp}$  ligand bonded to Co surface after  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  adsorption, but the weak saturation behavior is disturbed leading to CVD- like reaction at high dose of  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  leading to rapid increase in growth rate.

        "text": "In conclusion, Co PE- ALD processes were investigated using commercially available metallorganic precursors and  $\\mathrm{NH_3}$  plasma. The PE- ALD Co film has very low resistivity with high purity in contrast to thermal ALD Co using  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  as a reactant. While PE- ALD process using  $\\mathrm{CoCp(CO)_2}$  has shown incomplete self- saturation due to weak bonding of carbonyl ligand,  $\\mathrm{CoCp_2}$  has shown good saturation behavior. The formation of  $\\mathrm{CoSi_2}$  by post deposition annealing PE- ALD Co with Ti cap layer was also successfully demonstrated.",
