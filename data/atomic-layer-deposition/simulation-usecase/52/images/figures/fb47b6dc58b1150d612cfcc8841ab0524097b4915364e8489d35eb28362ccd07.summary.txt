The energy diagram illustrates various states of a system, including their respective energies in electron volts (eV). The diagram shows transitions between different states labeled as WF<sub>F</sub><sup>*</sup>, WF<sub>d</sub><sup>*</sup>, WF<sub>F</sub><sup>*</sup>, WF<sup>*</sup>, and W-F, with corresponding energy values.
