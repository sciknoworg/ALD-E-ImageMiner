        "text": "ABSTRACT: Area- selective atomic layer deposition using small- molecule inhibitors (SMIs) involves vapor- phase dosing of inhibitor molecules, resulting in an industry- compatible approach. However, the identification of suitable SMIs that yield a high selectivity remains a challenging task. Recently, aniline  $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{5}\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\right)$  was shown to be an effective SMI during the area- selective deposition (ASD) of TiN, giving  $6\\mathrm{nm}$  of selective growth on  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  in the presence of Ru and Co non- growth areas. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) and random sequential adsorption (RSA) simulations, we investigated how aniline can effectively block precursor adsorption on specific areas. Our DFT calculations confirmed that aniline selectively adsorbs on Ru and Co non- growth areas, whereas its adsorption on the  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  growth area is limited to physisorption. DFT reveals two stable adsorption configurations of aniline on the metal surfaces. Further calculations on the aniline- functionalized surfaces show that the aniline inhibitor significantly reduces the interaction of Ti precursor, tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium, with the non- growth area. In addition, RSA simulations showed that the co- presence of two stable adsorption configurations allows for a high surface inhibitor coverage on both Co and Ru surfaces. As the surface saturates, there is a transition from the thermodynamically most favorable adsorption configuration to the sterically most favorable adsorption configuration, which results in a sufficiently dense inhibition layer, such that an incoming precursor molecule cannot fit in between the adsorbed precursor molecules. We also found that, as a result of the catalytic activity of the metallic non- growth area, further reactions of inhibitor molecules, such as hydrogenolysis, can play a role in precursor blocking.",

Most of the conventional fabrication processes are designed on the basis of the top- down approach, comprising numerous deposition, lithography, and etching steps. At small feature sizes, traditional top- down approaches suffer from alignment issues between the patterning steps. Therefore, processes exploiting the properties of the underlying pattern instead of purely relying on metrology and patterning precision are needed. During the past decade, area- selective deposition (ASD), a bottom- up alternative enabling self- aligned fabrication schemes, has gained considerable attention in academia and industry. ASD refers to processes that deposit the target material on the areas where the growth is desired (i.e., growth areas), while deposition is avoided on the neighboring areas where the growth is not desired (non- growth areas). The selectivity of deposition on the growth areas can be achieved by exploiting differences in the chemical or physical properties, such as different material compositions, surface terminations, or lattice properties.",

The selective adsorption of the candidate SMI molecules can be investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the target growth and non- growth areas. Thus, important information on the adsorption energetics and the adsorption configurations of the SMIs can be obtained. Random sequential adsorption (RSA) simulations29,30 can be used to estimate the coverage and packing of inhibitor molecules as extensively discussed in our earlier work.31 As a consequence of vapor- phase dosing, SMIs arrive one by one on random surface sites such that close packing of inhibitor molecules cannot be achieved.9 This could be compensated by the selection of inhibitor molecules with high enough surface coverage and dense packing to block the incoming precursor molecules.

Among these two adsorption configurations, the chelate configuration was found to block BDEAS molecules successfully. However, Hacac molecules adsorbed in monodentate configuration can desorb during the purging step of the experiments or were displaced during the precursor dose and caused the loss of selectivity.32 According to these findings, it is needed to investigate all possible adsorption configurations of inhibitor molecules and their effect on the inhibition layer stability. In our recent experimental work, aniline showed promising performance as an inhibitor during the area- selective deposition of TiN on dielectrics as the growth area with respect to metals as the non- growth area. Using aniline as an inhibitor and tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT) as a Ti precursor, TiN growth was delayed for up to 100 cycles on Co and for more than 200 cycles on Ru non- growth areas. As a result, about  $6 \\mathrm{~nm}$  of selective TiN deposition on  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  and  $\\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$  was achieved.28",

A lattice RSA algorithm (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information) developed on the basis of our earlier work has been adopted in this study.31 This RSA algorithm simulates one- by- one adsorption of inhibitor molecules on randomly selected sites on a substrate representing the non- growth area during area- selective ALD. The DFT- optimized lattice dimensions of  $\\mathrm{Ru(0001)}$  and  $\\mathrm{Co(0001)}$  surfaces were used to model the substrates with periodic boundary conditions. Both model substrates were prepared to include 5000 adsorption sites, resulting in surface areas of 318 and  $273~\\mathrm{nm}^2$  for the Ru and Co surfaces, respectively. The top- down 2D projections, i.e., 2D footprints, of aniline and benzene molecules were modeled on the basis of the DFT- optimized adsorption configurations of molecules on the metal non- growth areas (see Figure 1 for the procedure and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information for other 2D footprint models). The horizontal aniline configuration is strongly adsorbed to the surface via the interactions of its multiple atoms with the surface, preventing free rotation. Therefore, rotation attempts for the footprint representing the horizontal configuration were considered on the basis of the 6- fold symmetry of the lattice (rotational attempts of  $60^{\\circ}$ ). On the other hand, the vertical aniline configuration is attached to the surface via a single bond between  $\\mathrm{N}$  and the surface metal. Hence, it is assumed to be able to rotate freely around the  $\\mathrm{M} - \\mathrm{N}$  bond.

Then, if it still did not fit,  $1^{\\circ}$  rotation steps were tested to cover a larger range of possible rotations. A reactive adsorption mode is also included in the algorithm to be able to simulate aniline adsorption with hydrogenolysis upon adsorption.

To this end, the adsorption of TDMAT was studied on bare and aniline- functionalized Ru and Co surfaces (see Figure 3). On bare surfaces, we found TDMAT adsorption energies of  $- 2.23$  and  $- 1.86\\mathrm{eV}$ , on Ru and Co, respectively. To study the interaction of the precursor with the adsorbed aniline molecule, TDMAT is placed above the aniline adsorbate optimized in previous steps (which were shown in Figure 2). The interaction of TDMAT with the vertical aniline configuration resulted in the transformation to the horizontal configuration. This change of the aniline adsorption configuration mainly occurs as a result of repulsion interactions between the inhibitor and precursor molecules and shows that TDMAT is not likely to adsorb on vertical aniline. This transition was possible because only one aniline molecule was present on the surface in the DFT calculation. Note that such a transition is sterically hindered on a surface saturated with aniline molecules in both configurations. We calculated the adsorption energy of TDMAT on surfaces with aniline in the horizontal configuration as  $- 0.87$  and  $- 0.90\\mathrm{eV}$  on Ru and Co, respectively. In both cases, TDMAT is physisorbed on aniline at a distance of  $2.6\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . The lower adsorption energy of TDMAT on the aniline- functionalized surface compared to the bare surface confirms that the aniline inhibitor significantly reduces the interaction of TDMAT with the non- growth area.",

In that case, we observed the formation of a H bond between the free OH group from adsorbed Hacac and the amino ligand in BDEAS, for some orientations of the BDEAS molecule. This interaction was described as the starting point for the displacement of the Hacac inhibitor from the surface by the precursor, which was experimentally observed. Interestingly, in the current analysis, the TDMAT adsorption energy on aniline is similar to that of BDEAS on Hacac. However, unlike the previous case, we do not observe such a H bond that could serve as a pathway for displacement. Although the thermodynamics of the aniline-",

DFT- optimized aniline geometries on Ru and Co surface slabs, shown in panels a and b of Figure 2, were used to determine the 2D footprints (see Figure S2 of the Supporting Information) of the aniline molecule on a hexagonal grid representing the Ru and Co non- growth areas. Sample RSA outputs showing the packing of aniline molecules on zoomed in views of the Ru and Co non- growth area models are given in panels a and d of Figure 4. Our RSA algorithm starts with the selection of a random surface site and tests the adsorption of the energetically most favorable, horizontal, configurations of aniline for each iteration of the RSA simulations. When the horizontal configuration could not fit, adsorption of the vertical configuration was tested on the same adsorption site. Therefore, the aniline adsorption on both surfaces is initially dominated by the most stable horizontal aniline configurations. With increasing aniline exposure, we see a transition from the thermodynamically most favorable configuration to the sterically most favorable (i.e. the vertical) configuration. The change of the surface density of the specific adsorption configurations as a function of total aniline density on the surface is plotted in panels b and e of Figure 4. At saturation represented by black dashed lines (1.72 molecules/  $\\mathrm{nm}^2$  in Figure 4b  $69\\pm 1\\%$  of the aniline molecules are present in the horizontal configuration on the Ru surface.

        "text": "In this work, on the basis of experimental results for the smallmolecule inhibitor aniline, we computationally investigated how SMIs can effectively block precursor adsorption on the non- growth area during area- selective ALD. As the first requirement for ASD, aniline strongly adsorbs on the nongrowth area, whereas its adsorption on the growth area is weak. From our DFT calculations for aniline and prior results for Hacac, it is concluded that all adsorption configurations of the inhibitor molecule should strongly adsorb on the non- growth area to obtain a stable inhibition layer. The case of aniline demonstrates that the presence of multiple stable binding configurations also results in a dense inhibitor packing, which helps the blocking of precursor adsorption on the non- growth area. As the surface starts to saturate, the energetically most favorable aniline configuration cannot adsorb on the remaining unoccupied sites. In that case, the sterically more favorable configuration can still adsorb to the surface and enhance the surface inhibitor density. The catalytic properties of the nongrowth area can also contribute to precursor blocking performance. The hydrogenolysis of the adsorbed aniline molecule is found to be thermodynamically favorable on the studied metallic non- growth areas. Such catalytic reactions on the non- growth area can enhance the inhibitor blocking on the non- growth area by increasing the fraction of the surface area covered and/or decreasing the number of available gaps on the surface. In addition, the removal of the reactive amine groups can eliminate the possible interactions with the precursors.",
