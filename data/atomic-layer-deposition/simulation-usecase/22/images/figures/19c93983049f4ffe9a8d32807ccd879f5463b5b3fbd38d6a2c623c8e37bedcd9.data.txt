| a | A molecular structure with a blue atom connected to yellow atoms, which are bonded to gray spheres forming a lattice. |
| b | A detailed view of a lattice structure with gray spheres representing atoms, and yellow atoms forming a hexagonal pattern. |
| c | A close-up of a hexagonal pattern within the lattice, highlighting the bonding between yellow and gray atoms. |
| d | A detailed view of a molecular structure with a blue atom at the center, surrounded by yellow atoms forming a hexagonal pattern, and a grid overlaying the structure. |
| e | A blue shape with black dots around it, possibly representing a molecular orbital or a specific region of interest. |
| f | A pattern of blue shapes with black dots, indicating a repeating structure or a distribution of molecular orbitals. |
