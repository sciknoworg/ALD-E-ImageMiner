The chart illustrates the growth rate over the inverse temperature (1000/T) for two sets of data: 'Experiment' and 'This work'. The 'Experiment' data points are represented by solid diamonds, while 'This work' data points are shown as dashed circles. The growth rate peaks at around 0.9 and then decreases sharply.
