One critical input needed for prediction of epitaxial thin film growth rates and uniformity is the chemistry occurring in the gas phase and at the surface. Traditionally, simplified chemistry derived from experimental observations has been used for this purpose. With the advent of modern high- speed computational techniques, it is now possible to formulate detailed reaction mechanisms using ab initio methods. Such detailed reaction mechanisms, comprising mostly of elementary reactions, have the advantage that they require little or no calibration. This paper presents a methodology in which the density functional theory, in combination with rate theories, was used to determine the reaction pathways and rates in the gas phase as well as at the surface for gallium nitride growth from tri- methyl gallium and ammonia. The reaction mechanisms were then used as input to a multi- dimensional CFD code enabling accurate prediction of growth rates. Validation studies were performed for four different laboratory- scale reactors, and one commercial reactor. In each case, the predictions agreed reasonably well with the experimental data indicating the universality of the reaction mechanisms."

At present, the technique of choice for depositing thin films of III- V semiconductor materials is metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE)."

The efficacy of such modeling is currently limited by the availability of chemical reaction mechanisms that describe the growth process. In the past, reaction rates have been obtained primarily by calibrating a reduced set of reactions against available experimental data, which in most cases, is somewhat limited. With the advent of highspeed computers it is now possible to explore larger reaction sets comprising of mostly elementary reactions using first- principle methods, such as density function theory (DFT). Such detailed reaction mechanisms can provide more generality and requires less calibration."

All of these mechanisms are based on the one proposed originally by Mihopoulos [4]. In their study, the activation barriers of some of the gasphase reaction steps were calculated using ab initio methods. Pre- exponential factors of the formation and dissociation of adducts were adjusted to reproduce the time versus concentration profiles obtained through experiments. While the ab initio methods were used to determine the activation energies of some of the gas- phase reactions, most of the surface reactions were considered to be collision- limited, and the activation barriers were calibrated. The salient feature of this mechanism is the formation of a \"ring compound (or a trimeric species) with molecular formula "

The proposed mechanism is based on first- principle calculations in combination with reaction rate theories, such as absolute rate theory (ART) and quantum Rice- Rapmsperger- Kassel (QRRK) [8]. The present mechanism is tested for several different reactors, and is able to reproduce experimental data consistently."

The activation barrier and vibrational frequencies for the decomposition of TMG and its intermediate products have been calculated using DFT method. These are subsequently used to calculate the rate constants as a function of temperature and pressure using QRRK theory. These reactions are pressure dependent, and the rate constants have been evaluated at a typical reactor pressure in which GaN is grown (approximately 76torr). In Fig. 1, the calculated rate constants for TMG decomposition have been compared with the experimental data of Jacko and Price [14], and shows excellent agreement.

However, considering the large number of surface reactions that one needs to examine, calculation with periodic boundary condition is still not practical. A popular simplifying alternative is to use the so- called cluster model, where only a small cluster of atoms on the surface is modeled [18- 20]. These cluster models have been successfully used by others [18- 20] to model surface reactions for silicon nitride, and atomic"

However, each surface atom has at least one dangling bond, and the surface atoms can accommodate adsorbates. In the present calculations, the reduced cluster model shown in Fig. 2 has been used for surface gallium and nitrogen atoms. The surface gallium atom is bonded to [3] nitrogen atoms, and the nitrogen atoms are terminated by three hydrogen atoms. Similarly, surface nitrogen is bonded to [3] gallium atoms, and they are terminated by three hydrogen atoms. The structures of the chemisorbed species were optimized using the method described in the previous section. The geometries of the clusters were fixed at their bulk values, and no geometry optimization was performed for the bare cluster. For adsorbed structures, the geometry of the adsorbate and the bond connecting the cluster and the adsorbate were optimized. For example, in structure of adsorbed MMG on nitrogen surface, all geometrical parameters in MMG and the Ga- N bond length were optimized while the N- Ga distance in the cluster remained fixed. In the crystal structure of GaN, the hydrogen atoms in "
