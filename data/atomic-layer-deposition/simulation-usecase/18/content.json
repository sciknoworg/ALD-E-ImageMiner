One critical input needed for prediction of epitaxial thin film growth rates and uniformity is the chemistry occurring in the gas phase and at the surface. Traditionally, simplified chemistry derived from experimental observations has been used for this purpose. With the advent of modern high- speed computational techniques, it is now possible to formulate detailed reaction mechanisms using ab initio methods. Such detailed reaction mechanisms, comprising mostly of elementary reactions, have the advantage that they require little or no calibration. This paper presents a methodology in which the density functional theory, in combination with rate theories, was used to determine the reaction pathways and rates in the gas phase as well as at the surface for gallium nitride growth from tri- methyl gallium and ammonia. The reaction mechanisms were then used as input to a multi- dimensional CFD code enabling accurate prediction of growth rates. Validation studies were performed for four different laboratory- scale reactors, and one commercial reactor. In each case, the predictions agreed reasonably well with the experimental data indicating the universality of the reaction mechanisms.",

Pre- exponential factors of the formation and dissociation of adducts were adjusted to reproduce the time versus concentration profiles obtained through experiments.

The activation barrier and vibrational frequencies for the decomposition of TMG and its intermediate products have been calculated using DFT method. These are subsequently used to calculate the rate constants as a function of temperature and pressure using QRRK theory. These reactions are pressure dependent, and the rate constants have been evaluated at a typical reactor pressure in which GaN is grown (approximately 76torr). In Fig. 1, the calculated rate constants for TMG decomposition have been compared with the experimental data of Jacko and Price [14], and shows excellent agreement. Our calculations show that TMG, DMG and MMG form strong adducts with  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ . The adducts subsequently eliminate  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$ . The adduct formation reaction and elimination of  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$  are not two independent reactions since the energy released by the formation of adducts is stored in quantized vibrational level of the adducts, and can be utilized to cross the activation barrier for  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$  elimination reaction. Therefore, these reactions have been treated via chemical activation [15,16] and the rate constants have been calculated using QRRK theory. In the earlier mechanism by Milopoulos [4] these reactions have been assumed to be independent to each other. These reactions are also pressure dependent because the adduct is initially at the energized state, and molecular collisions are needed to deactivate them. Following calculation of the gas- phase reaction rate constants, they were fitted to the modified Arrhenius expression [i.e.  $k(T) = AT^n \\exp (- E_a / RT)$ ]. The fitted rate constants for these reactions are shown in Table 1.",

However,  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$  can abstract one hydrogen atom from  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  to produce  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  with a low barrier (G11). Therefore, this reaction is included, in view of the fact that Ga and  $\\mathrm{NH}_2$  could combine to contribute to the deposition. Reactions G12 is active when  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  is the carrier gas, and produces active  $\\mathrm{H}$  atoms. The  $\\mathrm{H}$  atoms can enhance decomposition of TMG and DMG. Rate constants of G12, G13 and G14 were taken from literature [25].",

        "text": "As mentioned earlier, the proposed gas phase mechanism does not include \"ring\" formation, since it has been found recently that the concentration of  $\\mathrm{Ga(CH_3)_2NH_2}$ , the precursor to \"ring\" formation, is negligible under typical growth conditions [6]. The mass spectrometric studies of Bergman et al. [7] suggest that the concentration of the \"ring\" is negligible at all temperatures. Mazzarese et al. [26] performed FTIR and surface analysis for the TMG and  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  reaction below  $573\\mathrm{K}$ . They concluded that the final step for growth of  $\\mathrm{GaN}$  is the reaction between  $\\mathrm{Ga(CH_3)_x}$ $(x = 1 - 3)$  and  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  at the surface which produces  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$ . This work indicates that the methane eliminated product from  $\\mathrm{Ga(CH_3)_x\\cdot NH_3}$  can be formed at the surface rather than in the gas phase. These results suggest that the \"ring\" formation is more likely to occur at the surface via successive addition of  $\\mathrm{Ga(CH_3)_x}$  and  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  followed by methane elimination. Therefore, the proposed surface mechanism includes \"ring\" formation at the surface.",

When simulations were performed for this reactor geometry with various V- III ratio, it was indeed observed that the growth rate decreased with increasing V- III ratio (Fig. 13). A plausible explanation for this type of behavior is that as the V- III ratio is increased, the ammonia concentration near the substrate increases and the hydrogen concentration decreases. Since ammonia is much heavier than hydrogen, the diffusion of TMG in ammonia is much weaker than the diffusion of TMG in hydrogen. Consequently, although more ammonia is available to react at the surface, very little TMG actually diffuses in through the ammonia stream to the substrate. As the V- III ratio is decreased, hydrogen replaces ammonia,",
