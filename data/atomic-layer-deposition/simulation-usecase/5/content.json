        "text": "ABSTRACT: Area- selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) of  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  was achieved on  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  seed layer patterns on H- terminated silicon substrates, using diethylzinc (DEZ) as the zinc precursor and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as the coreactant. The selectivity of the ALD process was studied using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and scanning electron microscopy, revealing improved selectivity for increasing deposition temperatures from 100 to  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The selectivity was also investigated using transmission electron microscopy and energy- dispersive X- ray spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to corroborate the experimental results obtained and to provide an atomic- level understanding of the underlying surface chemistry. A kinetically hindered proton transfer reaction from the H- terminated Si was conceived to underpin the selectivity exhibited by the ALD process. By combining the experimental and DFT results, we suggest that the trend in selectivity with temperature may be due to a strong DEZ or  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  physiopotion on the H- terminated Si that hampers high selectivity at low deposition temperature. This work highlights the deposition temperature as an extra process parameter to improve the selectivity.",

The higher density of nucleation at  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  seems consistent with undesired reactions with physisorbed precursor or coreactant molecules on the NGA. Because the rate of desorption of physisorbed species decreases with decreasing the deposition temperature (for details see the Supporting Information, Figure S8), such physisorbed species may act as spurious nucleation sites and effectively decrease the selectivity of the process at low deposition temperatures.",
