        "text": "For the development of the future ultrahigh- scale integrated memory devices, a uniform tungsten (W) gate deposition process with good conformal film is essential for improving the conductivity of the W gate, resulting in the enhancement of device performance. As the memory devices are further scaled down, uniform W deposition becomes more difficult because of the experimental limitations of the subnanometer scale deposition even with atomic layer deposition (ALD) W processes. Even though it is known that the  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$  dosing process plays a key role in the deposition of the ALD W layer with low resistivity and in the removal of residual fluorine (F) atoms, the roles of  $\\mathsf{H}_2$  and  $\\mathsf{N}_2$  treatments used in the ALD W process have not yet been reported. To understand the detailed ALD W process, we have investigated the effects of  $\\mathsf{H}_2$  and  $\\mathsf{N}_2$  treatment on TiN surfaces for the  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$  dosing process using first- principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In our DFT calculated results,  $\\mathsf{H}_2$  treatment on the TiN surfaces causes the surfaces to become H- covered TiN surfaces, which results in lowering the reactivity of the  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$  precursor since the overall reactions of the  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$  on the H- covered TiN surfaces are energetically less favorable than the TiN surfaces. As a result, an effect of the  $\\mathsf{H}_2$  treatment is to decrease the reactivity of the  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$  molecule on the TiN surface. However,  $\\mathsf{N}_2$  treatment on the Ti- terminated TiN (111) surface is more likely to make the TiN surface become an N- terminated TiN (111) surface, which results in making a lot of N- terminated TiN (111) surfaces, having a very reactive nature for  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$  bond dissociation. As a result, the effect of  $\\mathsf{N}_2$  treatment serves as a catalyst to decompose  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$ . From the deep understanding of the effect of  $\\mathsf{H}_2$  and  $\\mathsf{N}_2$  during the  $\\mathsf{B}_2\\mathsf{H}_6$  dosing process, the use of proper gas treatment is required for the improvement of the W nucleation layers.",

In the first step, the decomposition processes of  $\\mathbf{H}_{2}$  and  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  treatment on the TiN surface were carefully analyzed.

It was found that dissociated H atoms in the final state were adsorbed on the hollow site made by three N atoms (Site number 3 in Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 3(a) and 4, the reaction energy of  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  is  $- 4.66\\mathrm{eV}$ , which indicates that the reaction is exothermic. The activation energy from the initial state to the final state is  $0.26\\mathrm{eV}$  with the transition state, indicating that this reaction requires a low energy barrier. However, as for the  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  in Fig. 3(b) and 4, the reaction energy of  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  is  $1.24\\mathrm{eV}$ , which indicates that the reaction is exothermic. In this case,  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  molecules were not dissociated on the surface. The activation energy from the initial state to the final state is  $1.45\\mathrm{eV}$  with the transition state. We found that the  $\\mathrm{H} - \\mathrm{H}$  bond breaking on the N- terminated TiN (111) surfaces was much more facile compared to those of both TiN (001) and Ti- terminated TiN (111) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 4. This result is primarily because the binding energy  $(E_{\\mathrm{b}} = 5.73\\mathrm{eV})$  of H atoms on the N- terminated TiN (111) surface is the highest among the three different TiN surfaces, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the decomposition of  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  on the N- terminated TiN (111) surface is energetically favorable due to the downhill reaction and small energy barrier for  $\\mathrm{H} - \\mathrm{H}$  bond breaking. However, the N- terminated TiN (111) surface was not advantageous for breaking the N- N bond because  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  was not dissociated on the N- terminated TiN (111) surface. Although the  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  molecule has a larger bond dissociation energy  $(E_{\\mathrm{dissociation}} = 9.45\\mathrm{eV})^{53}$  than  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ $(E_{\\mathrm{dissociation}} = 4.36\\mathrm{eV})^{53}$  due to the triple bonding nature of  $\\mathbf{N}_2$ , this  $\\mathbf{N}_2$  molecule could be dissociated on the Ti- terminated TiN (111) surface. We suggest that this phenomenon is attributed to a large binding energy  $(E_{\\mathrm{b}} = 11.0\\mathrm{eV})$  of the N atom on the Ti- terminated TiN (111) surface, as depicted in Table 1.",

Since W nucleation layers are experimentally difficult to grow using only  $\\mathrm{WF}_6$  molecules without the  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  dosing process,  ${}^{54}\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  should be easily dissociated on the TiN surfaces for obtaining high- quality W nucleation layers during the W ALD process. Although  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  molecules play a role in lowering the reactivity of  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  on the TiN surfaces, this molecule can be useful to remove residual F atoms, which degrade the quality of the W layer. It has been reported that ALD W deposition under  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  exposure helps to remove residual F atoms by the desorption of  $\\mathrm{HF}$ . The previous experimental results and our theoretical results provide insight into how to design the ALD W deposition process to develop the W films for highly integrated devices.",

        "text": "In summary, we investigated the effects of  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  and  $\\mathbb{N}_2$  treatment on TiN surfaces for the  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  dosing process based on DFT calculation. Since the  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  molecule is easily dissociated on both Ti- terminated TiN (111) and N- terminated TiN (111) surfaces, H- covered Ti- terminated TiN (111) and H- covered N- terminated TiN (111) surfaces can be made. In our DFT calculated results,  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  treatment on the TiN surfaces convert the surfaces into H- covered TiN surfaces, which results in lowering the reactivity of the  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  precursor since the overall reactions of the  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  on the H- covered TiN surfaces are energetically less favorable than the TiN surfaces. As a result, an effect of the  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  treatment is to decrease the reactivity of the  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  molecule on the TiN surface. However,  $\\mathbb{N}_2$  treatment on the Ti- terminated TiN (111) surface is more likely to make the surface an N- terminated TiN (111) surface, which results in making a lot of N- terminated TiN (111) surfaces with very reactive nature for  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  bond dissociation. As a result, the effect of  $\\mathbb{N}_2$  treatment serves as a catalyst to decompose  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$ . Although the  $\\mathbb{N}_2$  molecule is more useful for  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  bond dissociation than  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  in regard to the reactivity, the  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  molecule has a greater advantage for the removal of residual F atoms than  $\\mathbb{N}_2$ .
