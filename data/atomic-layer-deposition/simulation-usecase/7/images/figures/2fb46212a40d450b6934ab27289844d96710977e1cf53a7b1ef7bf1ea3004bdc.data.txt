| Subfigure | Description |
|---|---|
| a | A molecular structure with a central atom labeled '3 c.n.' connected to three other atoms.
| b | A molecular structure with a central atom connected to multiple atoms, showing a higher coordination number than subfigure a.
| c | A molecular structure similar to subfigure a, but with additional molecules around it.
| d | A molecular structure with a central atom labeled '5 c.n.' connected to five other atoms, indicating a higher coordination number than subfigure a and b.
