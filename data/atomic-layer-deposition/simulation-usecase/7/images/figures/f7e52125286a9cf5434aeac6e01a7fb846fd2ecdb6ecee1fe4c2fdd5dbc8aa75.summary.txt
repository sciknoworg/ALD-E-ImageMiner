The chart displays two 3D molecular structures labeled 'a' and 'b'. Both structures feature a central blue atom bonded to a gray atom, with a network of red atoms surrounding them. Structure 'b' appears to have additional red atoms attached, indicating a possible change in the molecular configuration or state.
