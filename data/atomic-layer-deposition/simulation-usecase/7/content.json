We inspected all energy steps, from the early stage of adsorption of each ALD precursor to the densification of multiple atoms into bulk- like  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  layers. The activation energy calculations show that repeated proton diffusion from the surface to amide ligands and rotation of the protonated amine is more energetically accessible than the simple elimination of the amine in the initial stage. We therefore propose that multiple protons diffuse to the amide ligands of the Hf precursor before desorption of protonated ligands takes place. Loss of a proton from surface oxygen frees it up for bonding to Hf of the precursor. Protonation of ligands, and especially desorption of ligands, frees up Hf for bonding to surface oxygen. These effects are termed densification\", as they bring  $\\mathrm{Hf - O}$  packing closer to the bulk scenario. Densification is associated with substantial release of energy. During the metal pulse, saturation of the surface by remaining fragments HfX causes adsorption of further metal precursor to stop. The presence of these fragments prevents further chemisorption of  $\\mathrm{HfX_4},$  since this requires the creation of a strong dative bond between Hf and O. Next, during the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  pulse, Hf exchanges its remaining ligands with OH groups. The exchange occurs due to the decomposition of adsorbed  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  molecules in clusters of HfX. Decomposition of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  when adsorbed onto a  $\\mathrm{(Hf(NMe_2)_4)}_x(x\\geq 2)$  cluster (e.g., dimers) also increases the coordination of Hf and O. Simultaneously, low- coordinated oxygen atoms appear at the surface, which are reactive sites for the next metal pulse. With saturation of the surface by OH groups,  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  molecules begin to appear. This detailed description of ALD chemistry allows us to make qualitative predictions about how the process depends on temperature. The data can also be inputted into kinetic simulations for a quantitative view of the complex film growth process.",

This means that, when the substrate is covered with fragments of precursor at the end of each pulse, other precursors in the gas phase are not able to react with the surface any more.

Therefore, in the current study of metal alkylamide precursors, we consider both the change in entropy and the influence of under- coordinated atoms and find exothermic reactions, which resolves the discrepancy between experiment and theory. Here we should emphasize that some aspect of the reaction pathways for amides is different from those of halides. The amide is more bulky and more reactive toward a hydroxylated surface than the chloride. The amide ligands are more Bronsted basic than chloride ligands.

Several reaction paths were regarded to find how the proton moves. The ligand needs space to rotate, and this is facilitated by lengthening of the Hf O bond between the entire precursor and the surface. Such lengthening apparently costs more energy for surf- O- Hf  $(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\sim 1.78 \\mathrm{eV}$  for rotation of HX) than for surf- OH- Hf  $(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\sim 0.51 \\mathrm{eV})$  (Figure 2 and Table 1, reaction 9). In other words, a higher barrier exists toward amide rotation when the precursor is attached to terminal oxygen, and this is probably because terminal oxygen does not allow the precursor to move away from the surface as easily as OH does. The adsorption mode thus affects the rate of proton diffusion and hence of ligand elimination and ALD growth. The bond length between the Hf of the precursor and the surface OH (c.n. = 3) is slightly decreased from 2.18 to 2.15 Å because of the rotation of the protonated ligand in  $\\mathrm{Hf(H_{dn}X)X_3\\rightleftharpoons Hf(H_{up}X)X_3}$ .",

We include all steps, from the early stage of adsorption of each ALD precursor to the densification of multiple atoms into bulklike  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  layers. The resulting reactions, which explain the fundamental chemistry of ALD at low temperatures (below 500 K), are outlined below.",

Chemisorption of precursors is only possible at surface sites of sufficient Lewis activity, namely, terminal O and OH for  $\\mathrm{Hf(NMe}_2\\mathrm{)}_4$  and  $\\mathrm{(Hf(NMe}_2\\mathrm{)}_x(x\\geq 2)$  cluster (e.g., dimers) for  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ . Saturated surfaces do not have these sites and so resist further adsorptions. This explains the self- limiting reactions that distinguish ALD from other techniques.",

The activation energy calculations show that repeated proton diffusion from the surface to the amide ligand and rotation of the protonated amine is more energetically accessible than the simple elimination of the amine in the initial stage. Due to multiple proton diffusion to the fragments, the dative bonds between Hf and N are weakened. This reduction in bond strength facilitates the desorption of fragments from the precursor. The resulting activation energies for protonation and desorption of ligands are low enough that these reactions can take place in low temperature ALD. Multiple proton diffusion is seen in all the stages of ligand elimination.",

        "text": "Densification. Loss of a proton from oxygen frees it up for bonding to Hf of the precursor. Protonation of ligands, and especially desorption of ligands, frees up Hf for bonding to surface oxygen. Decomposition of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  at the surface also increases the coordination of Hf and O. These effects are termed \"densification\", as they bring Hf- O packing closer to the bulk scenario. Densification is hence accompanied by substantial energy gain, and this can be the driving force that facilitates ligand eliminations at the surface and vacancy filling in subsurface layers. Densification thus accounts for some of the important characteristics of ALD, such as conformal growth.",

        "text": "Saturated Surfaces. During the early stage of the metal pulse, due to the saturation of the surface by remaining fragments HfX, adsorption of further metal precursor stops. The presence of these fragments prevents further chemisorption of  $\\mathrm{HfX}_4$ , since this requires the creation of a strong dative bond between Hf and O. A separate effect is depletion of coreagent (protons) at the surface as HX desorbs. Clearly, no further elimination of HX is possible once protons are exhausted. If the surface can store a higher population of coreagent, then a higher growth rate is expected.27 Next, during the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  pulse, Hf exchanges its remaining ligands with OH groups. The exchange occurs due to the decomposition of adsorbed  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  molecules in clusters of HfX. Simultaneously, low coordinated oxygen atoms appear at the surface, which are reactive sites for the next metal pulse. With saturation of the surface by OH groups,  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  molecules begin to appear. These molecules are loosely bonded to the surface and readily desorb, reducing the growth rate, especially at high temperatures.",
