The results show that  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  chemisorbs on the hollow site of the  $\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$  surface and decomposes easily into a  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  atom and the acac- ligands. A sequential dissociation and reduction of the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  precursor  $[\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Cu(acac)} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}]$  are observed. Further decomposition of the acac- ligand is unfavorable on the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  surface. Thus additional adsorption of the precursors may be blocked by adsorbed ligands. Molecular hydrogen is found to be nonreactive towards  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  on  $\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$ , whereas individual  $\\mathrm{H}$  atoms easily lead to bond breaking in the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  precursor upon impact, and thus release the surface ligands into the gas- phase. On the other hand, water reacts with  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  on a  $\\mathrm{Cu}_2\\mathrm{O}$  substrate through a ligand- exchange reaction, which produces gaseous  $\\mathrm{H(acac)}$  and surface  $\\mathrm{OH}$  species.

Of the various deposition techniques applied for Cu metallization, electrochemical deposition (ECD) is the preferred choice. However, the ECD process requires conductive seed layers. Moreover, diffusion barrier films are needed to deposit between the Cu seed layer and the patterned dielectrics in order to prevent the migration of  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  into the Si substrate and the dielectrics. So far, ionized physical vapor deposition (iPVD) using ionized sputtering techniques in combination with high re- sputter ratio regimes has been adopted as the desirable method for the barrier and Cu seed layer deposition. However, with the ongoing scaling down and aspect ratio increase of devices, iPVD tends to fail due to its inherent nonconformal deposition characteristic.",

ALD is a gas- phase thin film deposition technique based on sequential, self- terminating reactions between the surface and precursors.4,5 The typical ALD process consists of four repetitive steps. The precursor (typically a metal compound) chemisorbs on reactive sites, saturates the surface and releases the reaction by- products. After that, unreacted precursor molecules as well as gaseous byproducts are purged from the reactor. The co- reactant (typically a non- metal compound) is then supplied to clean up the surface of contaminations and deposit the desired species (e.g. oxygen or hydroxyl groups). Finally, another purging phase is introduced to evacuate the excessive reactants and products. By repeating these steps, the film growth is self- limiting, which leads to excellent step coverage and conformal deposition on high aspect ratio structures.",

These approaches consist of two steps: (1) ALD of the Cu oxide or nitride, and (2) reduction into the metallic Cu with a reducing agent. Waechtler et al. $^{10}$  investigated the ALD of  $\\mathrm{Cu_2O}$  thin films on different diffusion barriers (e.g. Ta, TaN, and Ru) using  $(^{n}\\mathrm{Bu}_{3}\\mathrm{P})_{2}\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}$  (Bu = butyl) and wet oxygen.

In general, the  $\\mathrm{Cu(I)}$ $\\beta$  - diketonates are more reactive compared to  $\\mathrm{Cu(II)}$ $\\beta$  - diketonates. However, the main limitation of  $\\mathrm{Cu(I)}$ $\\beta$  - diketonates is that these precursors may easily undergo a disproportionation reaction, which defeats the self- limiting nature of ALD processes. $^{9}$  Previous in situ X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggest that the disproportionation of the  $(^{n}\\mathrm{Bu}_{3}\\mathrm{P})_{2}\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}$  precursor, which deposits metallic Cu and releases gaseous  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)_2}$ , starts above  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  on  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  or above  $125^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  on the Co substrate. $^{26,27}$  Hence, the upper temperature limit for copper ALD using this precursor lies below these temperatures. Another important issue regarding  $\\mathrm{Cu}\\beta$  - diketonates is the redox chemistry during the ALD. In many cases, especially when metal ALD is desired, the metal center in a precursor is required to undergo an oxidation or reduction step. It is generally assumed that such a step is accomplished during the second ALD half- cycle, which is associated with the promotion of a co- reactant. $^{28}$  Recent surface- science studies, however, illuminated that oxidation state changes in the metal can occur upon precursor activated adsorption on the substrate, involving the partial loss and transformation of ligands. For example, the initial loss of acac- ligands of the  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)_2}$  precursor was observed at 200 and  $235\\mathrm{K}$  for  $\\mathrm{Ni(110)}$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$  single- crystal surfaces, respectively. $^{29}$  The formation of a metal- Cu(acac) complex was proposed.

On the  $\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$  surface we consider four different adsorption sites: top (T), hollow (H), bridge1 (B1) and bridge2 (B2) (see Fig. 2a). For each position, different adsorption orientations of species were examined.

        "text": "Our RMD simulations predict the following reaction scheme which is consistent with previous findings. Firstly,  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)_2}$  dissociates into  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}$  and acac on the surface after  $\\sim 25$  ps of simulation. Secondly, a proton is transferred from water to the adsorbed  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}$ , forming  $\\mathrm{Cu[H(acac)]}$  and  $\\mathrm{OH}$  species on the surface  $(56.8~\\mathrm{ps})$ . Finally, the  $\\mathrm{Cu - O}$  bond of the  $\\mathrm{Cu[H(acac)]}$  intermediate is then broken after  $118.6~\\mathrm{ps}$ , which leads to the desorption of acetylacetone from the surface to the gas- phase. A similar ligand- exchange mechanism has been widely observed in water- based metal oxide ALD, for example, in the  $\\mathrm{TMA - H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  (TMA = trimethylaluminum) or  $\\mathrm{H}(\\mathrm{NMe}_2)_4\\mathrm{- H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  (Me =  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ ) process.5,45 During the water pulse, the adsorbed Me- or  $\\mathrm{NMe}_2$ - ligands are replaced by  $- \\mathrm{OH}$  groups, followed by the elimination of gaseous  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$  or  $\\mathrm{HNMe}_2$ .5,45 It is noticed that cleavage of the  $\\mathrm{Cu - O}$  bond of  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)_2}$  in the presence of atomic  $\\mathrm{H}$  is promoted upon  $\\mathrm{H}$  impact, whereas with water the proton transition takes place after  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)_2}$  is completely dissociated on the surface. These observations suggest that water is much less reactive compared to the atomic  $\\mathrm{H}$ . As shown in Fig. 8c, it can be found that  $\\mathrm{H(acac)}$  is the main gaseous product during this reaction, while the amounts of acac and  $\\mathrm{H}_2(\\mathrm{acac})$  are minor. The surface reaction between  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  and the acac- ligand reaches stationary equilibrium after about  $400~\\mathrm{ps}$ , in which about  $35 - 40\\%$  of the acac- ligands are released to the gas- phase.",

The  $\\mathrm{CuO}(111)$  surface is used in these simulations, which is in line with the experimental observation that  $\\mathrm{CuO}$  is deposited by a  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)_2}$ -  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALD process.11 As depicted in Fig. 10, the ozone molecule is found to bind readily with the methyl group through a hydrogen bond, forming an  $\\mathrm{O - H}$  bond with a length of  $\\sim 1.9$  Å (Fig. 10a). One  $\\mathrm{H}$  atom of the acac- ligand is then abstracted by the ozone, as a result of the  $\\mathrm{OH}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  formation  $(16.8~\\mathrm{ps})$ . The released  $\\mathrm{OH}$  radical either re- adsorbs on the surface or reacts with methyl hydrogen to produce  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ $(99.4~\\mathrm{ps})$ . Moreover, we observed that the  $\\mathrm{O}$  atom can insert into the  $\\mathrm{C - H}$  bond of the  $- \\mathrm{CH}_3$  group, which involves the formation of  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  and  $- \\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{OH}$  species  $(94.3~\\mathrm{ps})$ . A similar insertion step has been reported to occur in the  $\\mathrm{TMA - O}_3$  ALD process, proven by infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculations.47,74,75 In comparison to the hydrogen abstraction, the  $\\mathrm{C - C}$  cleavage usually takes place later. As shown in Fig. 11a- c, an oxygen atom firstly adsorbs above the bridging  $\\mathrm{C - C}$  site to form an epoxide  $(92.2~\\mathrm{ps})$ . The  $\\mathrm{C - C}$  bond is then cleaved by the  $\\mathrm{O}$  atom through an epoxy- ether transformation  $(93.2~\\mathrm{ps})$ . At the same time, the acac- ligand breaks the bond with the surface  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  and is thus released to the gas- phase. Subsequently, the formed complex dissociates into the gaseous methylglyoxal,",

In experiment, it is well known that reactivity of the co- reactant has a large effect on an ALD temperature window. The lower bound of the ALD window is mainly determined by the thermal activation of a surface reaction as well as by the volatility of the precursor. Therefore, the ALD window could be used as an indicator to evaluate the reactivity between  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  and different co- reactants. A lower ALD window is associated with the higher reactivity of the co- reactant. As reported in the literature, when the  $\\mathrm{H}$  plasma is used for  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$ , the ALD window is as low as  $85 - 135^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . However, much higher temperatures are required when ozone  $(150 - 230^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})^{11}$  or water  $(210 - 300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})^{76}$  is used as the co- reactant. These results may suggest that the plasma  $\\mathrm{H}$  is more reactive towards  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  as compared to ozone and water, which is consistent with our conclusion.",

        "text": "In conclusion, the initial surface reactions of the  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  precursor during ALD were studied through DFT calculations and RMD simulations. The  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$ ,  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  species prefer to adsorb on a hollow site, whereas the acac- ligand favors adsorption on the top site of the  $\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$  surface. The adsorption energies calculated by ReaxFF agree well with those calculated by vdW- DF.  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  is easily decomposed into a  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  atom and acac- ligands on the  $\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$  surface. The largest reaction barriers calculated using PBE and vdW- DF functionals are  $0.59\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $0.55\\mathrm{eV}$ , respectively. Mulliken analysis reveals a sequential reduction of the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  atom during the dissociation of  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  on  $\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$ . The dissociated acac- ligands may act as site blockers for additional adsorption of the precursors, since they are thermodynamically stable on the surface. The RMD simulations imply that the decomposition pathways of  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  on various substrates are similar, but the copper- rich surfaces  $[\\mathrm{Cu(110)}$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu}_2\\mathrm{O}(111)]$  are more reactive as compared with the  $\\mathrm{CuO(111)}$  surface. Mechanisms for the surface reaction between  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  and different co- reactants are also examined. The molecular hydrogen is found to be nonreactive towards the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  precursor; whereas atomic  $\\mathrm{H}$  or water can remove the surface acac- ligands efficiently. The  $\\mathrm{H}$  atoms continuously impact with the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  precursor, which lead to the breaking of  $\\mathrm{Cu - O}$ ,  $\\mathrm{C - O}$ , and  $\\mathrm{C - C}$  bonds sequentially. On the other hand, water reacts with the  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  on  $\\mathrm{Cu}_2\\mathrm{O}(111)$  through a ligand- exchange reaction, producing the gaseous  $\\mathrm{H(acac)}$  and surface  $\\mathrm{OH}$  species. A combustion reaction with  $\\mathrm{CO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as the main byproducts is observed when adsorbed  $\\mathrm{Cu(acac)}_2$  reacts with ozone. Once equilibrium is reached, most of the gaseous  $\\mathrm{H}_x\\mathrm{O}_y$  are re- adsorbed on the surface. Thus protons are available for the next ALD half cycle.",
