We find that the hydrogen- transfer pathway (Figure 2) is kinetically the most favorable because its rate- limiting step has the lowest activation barrier. In particular, although the hydrogen- transfer and the ethyl group- transfer pathways result in exactly the same products, the activation barrier of the hydrogen- transfer pathway is much lower. The difference in activation barriers can be explained by classic organic chemistry principles. The hydrogen- transfer reaction can be considered to be a proton- transfer reaction between two ethoxyl groups, and the ethyl group- transfer reaction is analogous to a nucleophilic substitution reaction. In both cases, the ethoxyl group of the complex acts as a nucleophile. In the transition state for hydrogen transfer, the ethoxyl group attacks the proton of the hydroxyl group from its back side, and the interaction is symmetry- allowed. Therefore, the hydrogen- transfer pathway has a low activation barrier. However, back- side attack is not favorable in the ethyl group- transfer process because of the close proximity of the two ethoxyl groups in the adsorbed complex. As a result, the transition state for ethyl group transfer involves a front- side attack of the ethyl group by the ethoxyl nucleophile, which is symmetry- forbidden; consequently, the ethyl group- transfer pathway involves a high activation barrier. This orbital symmetry argument has been used to explain the difference between proton transfer and nucleophilic substitution reactions of methylamines on the "
