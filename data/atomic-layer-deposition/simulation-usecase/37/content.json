ALD is the leading process for the controlled deposition of thin films in a variety of technologies. For example, insulating alumina layers are fabricated by ALD for electroluminescent flat- screen displays and for node DRAM, and are under investigation as high-  $k$  dielectrics for the MOSFET gate. To develop and optimise an ALD process for a new material requires knowledge of the reaction mechanism. By combining structures computed at the quantum mechanical level and literature data from in situ experiments, we develop a quantitative model of the ALD reaction cycle for alumina deposition. We are thus able to identify the intrinsic limits on ALD growth and explain how the growth rate depends on process conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

First Principles density functional calculations are combined with literature data to determine the likely intermediates during the reaction cycle and their surface concentrations. This mechanistic information allows a quantitative portrait of the reaction to be sketched in the space of the coverage of intermediates. As well as giving an estimate of the maximum theoretical rate, the reaction portrait illustrates the effect of lower  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$  or OH coverage (high temperature) and of lower H mobility (low temperature), both consistent with experiment. As a general rule, the highest growth rate is achieved when as much  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$  is evolved during the TMA pulse as possible. The use of reaction portraits will simplify the analysis and design of deposition processes.",
