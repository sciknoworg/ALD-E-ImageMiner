The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the distance between carbon atoms (R<sub>C-C</sub>) and the energy change (Î”E) and the carbon-hydrogen bond length (C-H). As the distance between carbon atoms increases, the energy change decreases, while the carbon-hydrogen bond length remains relatively constant.
