The DFT results can be substantially improved at almost no additional computational cost by adding a correction to account for the missing dispersion energy. Dispersion interactions are usually much weaker than covalent or ionic bonds such that their contribution is often neglected, particularly where chemisorption takes place. However, considering the large weight of Cl in DCS, it is pertinent to evaluate the influence of dispersion forces on the energetics of adsorption, desorption and dissociation of DCS.
