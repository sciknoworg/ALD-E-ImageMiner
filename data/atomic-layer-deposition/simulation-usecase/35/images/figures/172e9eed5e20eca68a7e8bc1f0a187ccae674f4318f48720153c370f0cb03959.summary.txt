The scatter plots depict the relationship between the concentration of hydroxyl groups (c<sub>(O)H</sub>) and changes in surface area (ΔC<sub>Al</sub>, ΔC<sub>Me</sub>) for different materials at various temperatures. The linear regression equations and their coefficients are provided for each material.
