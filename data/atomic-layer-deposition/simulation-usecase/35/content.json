[6] GPC can be expressed for an  $\\mathrm{M} - n_{n} / \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  ALD process, for example, as the amount of M atoms deposited per unit surface area  $(\\Delta c_{\\mathrm{M}})$ , fractions of monolayers of the  $\\mathrm{MO}_{n / 2}$  material,  $\\mathrm{MO}_{n / 2}$  mass increment per unit surface area, and  $\\mathrm{MO}_{n / 2}$  thickness increment. GPC is an alternative term to replace the commonly used (see, e.g., references [4,5,7]) but problematic [8–10] term “growth rate”, and it was proposed already in 1986 by Goodman and Pessa [11] and recently again by Puurunen [8–10].",

(4)), the change in the number of OH groups  $\\Delta c_{(O)H}$  during the reaction should in principle be used instead of the total number of OH groups before the reaction  $c_{(O)H}$  [8]. The use of  $c_{(O)H}$  is justified, however, because practically all OH groups react with  $\\mathrm{AlMe}_3$  [20,21]. [29] L.M. Yeddanapalli, C.C. Schubert, J. Chem. Phys. 14 (1946) 1–7. [30] The deviation of  $b^{- 1}$  from three originates from the small increase of  $\\Delta c_{\\mathrm{Me}}$  with increasing  $c_{(O)H}$ . The increase of  $\\Delta c_{\\mathrm{Me}}$  is possible in the case when the methyl ligands can be packed closer to each other in the surface layer at lower values of  $z$  in the  $\\mathrm{AlMe}_z$  surface species.",
