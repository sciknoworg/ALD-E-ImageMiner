The chart illustrates energy changes during chemical reactions involving Ge, Al, C, and H atoms. It shows the energy levels at different stages of reactions such as Ge-H* + Al(CH₃)₃ → Ge-Al(CH₃)₂* + CH₄, Ge-H* + H₂O → Ge-OH* + H₂, and Ge-* + Al(CH₃)₃ → Ge-Al(CH₃)₃* followed by Ge-Al(CH₃)₃* + Ge-H* → Ge-Al(CH₃)₂* + CH₄ + Ge-*.
