The line charts illustrate the relationship between ALD cycles and various parameters such as capacitance (C_max), current density (J_G), sum of voltage shifts (∑ΔV_FB), and dielectric constant (D_it). The data points show a general trend where some parameters increase while others decrease with increasing ALD cycles.
