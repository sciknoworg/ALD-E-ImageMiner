Complex and manifold reaction pathways are possible, which are strongly affected by the surface chemical state. Here, we report a "

Compared to other thin film deposition techniques, ALD has a unique set of advantages: (i) atomic scale control of film thickness, (ii) high conformity on structures with high aspect ratios, (iii) deposition of continuous and pinhole- free layers, (iv) low process temperatures, and (v) excellent scalability due to low cost and large area deposition. Considering the large application space in diverse technological areas, it seems surprising that relatively little is known quantitatively about the kinetic processes in ALD at an atomic level. Optimizing deposition conditions is simple, inexpensive, fast, and straightforward. A qualitative understanding of the processes at play is sufficient for rapid process development. On the other hand, it has proven challenging to obtain a theoretical description with sufficient details at reasonable computational costs to realistically model the processes occurring at the "

The currently employed strategy toward ever efficient computing hardware is continuing miniaturization along with functional diversification, which requires the integration of more materials at the nanoscale with potentially dissimilar and incompatible chemistries. Achieving this will require the capability of predicting experimental outcomes and a quantitative understanding of ALD processes beyond simple trial and error optimization. Even simple changes of materials in complex process flows are becoming a challenging task such as replacing Si with high mobility semiconductors like germanium (Ge) or III- V"
