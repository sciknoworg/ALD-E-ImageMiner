The line chart illustrates the relationship between gate voltage and drain current for various plasma treatments applied to a semiconductor device. The treatments include O2 plasma, N2O plasma, and O2 plasma, each with different durations. The chart shows that the drain current increases with increasing gate voltage, and the treatments affect the threshold voltage (Î”VTH) of the device.
