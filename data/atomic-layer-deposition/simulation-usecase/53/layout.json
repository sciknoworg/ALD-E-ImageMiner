The ALD of oxides and nitrides is usually thought to be mechanistically similar, but plasma- enhanced ALD of silicon nitride is found to be problematic, while that of silicon oxide is straightforward. To find why, the ALD of silicon nitride and silicon oxide dielectric films was studied by applying ab initio methods to theoretical models for proposed surface reaction mechanisms.

Using more realistic cluster models of amine and hydroxyl covered surfaces, the structures and energies were calculated of reaction pathways for chemisorption of different silicon precursors via functional group elimination, with more success. DFT calculations identified the initial physisorption step as crucial toward deposition and this step was thus used to predict the ALD reactivity of a range of amino- silane precursors, yielding good agreement with experiment. The retention of hydrogen within silicon nitride films but not in silicon oxide observed in FTIR spectra was accounted for by the theoretical calculations and helped verify the application of the model."

Figure 2 compares the relative reactivity for simple chloro- silane precursors (e.g., DCS, HCDS, etc.), whereas similar data (not shown) has been obtained using amino- silane precursors (e.g., BTBAS, BDEAS, etc.). Precursor exposure was varied by changing the exposure time, the exposure partial pressure, or both. Deposition rate was determined by measurement of the thickness after deposition and dividing by the number of ALD cycles performed. The very long precursor exposure for deposition of silicon nitride makes this process economically unviable, due to both the excessive throughput time per film deposited and the unacceptably high volume of silicon precursors consumed.

Various theoretical approaches are used including model reaction pathways, acidity/basicity of the oxide vs nitride surfaces and overall energetics as a function of precursor functional group. A variety of silicon precursors will be taken into account with particular consideration of amino- silane precursors. Amino- silane precursors would be preferred in the ALD of silicon nitride due to the detrimental incorporation of chlorine in films deposited using chlorosilanes. Other potential precursors such as the alkyloxysilanes tetraethoxysilane and 3- aminopropyltriethoxysilane will not be considered in this work because of their unsuitability in the deposition of silicon nitride and their very different amine- catalyzed mechanisms.

All optimized structures and energies (including those of the transition states) were calculated using the generalized gradient approximation Becke- Perdew density functional BP86 with the resolution of identity (RI) approximation. Atom- centered basis sets were used for all atoms in this work: the large def2- TZVPP basis set for amination/hydrolysis thermodynamic calculations and the smaller defSV(P) basis set for both cluster models. The BP86 density functional was selected due to its computational efficiency and reasonable accuracy compared to hybrid functionals. Transition- state structures were optimized by following a vector with a negative eigenvalue (or imaginary frequency) corresponding to the reaction pathway of interest. These transition vectors were determined by performing a vibrational analysis."

Experiments also show significantly different deposition rates between the precursors employed in the deposition of silicon nitride. To explain these differences, we have applied various theoretical models employing DFT calculations. Thermodynamic models using DFT calculated energies correctly predict the lower reactivity of silicon precursors with amine- terminated surfaces compared to hydroxylated surfaces, but failed to predict the trends in reactivity between precursors. A mechanistic pathway for growth involving the elimination of a precursor functional group via proton transfer mechanism was applied first to small molecules representing surface groups and then to larger cluster models of silicon nitride and silicon oxide surfaces. A significant difference in reactivity is observed because of the orientation of the hydrogen atoms attached to the hydroxyl and amine groups, where in- coming precursors approach the OH group vertically and approach the "

By contrast, the same mechanism predicts that hydrogen is only present on the surface of silicon oxide film. In the experimental FTIR absorption spectra, vibrational bands associated with NH bonds in silicon nitride are indeed detected, in contrast with a lack of OH vibrational bands in silicon oxide. This helps validate the proposed growth mechanism and theoretical approach. Due the relative unreactivity of NH groups toward functional group elimination, the plasma assisted ALD silicon nitride is much slower compared to that of silicon oxide systems and requires longer precursor exposure. Targeted reduction in precursor bulk may improve the situation, but the main reason is the inflexible orientation of amine groups at the surface, which is an intrinsic property of the silicon nitride material being deposited."
