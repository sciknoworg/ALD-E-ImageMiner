        "text": "ABSTRACT: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of highly conformal, silicon- based dielectric thin films has become necessary because of the continuing decrease in feature size in microelectronic devices. The ALD of oxides and nitrides is usually thought to be mechanistically similar, but plasma- enhanced ALD of silicon nitride is found to be problematic, while that of silicon oxide is straightforward. To find why, the ALD of silicon nitride and silicon oxide dielectric films was studied by applying ab initio methods to theoretical models for proposed surface reaction mechanisms. The thermodynamic energies for the elimination of functional groups from different silicon precursors reacting with simple model molecules were calculated using density functional theory (DFT), explaining the lower reactivity of precursors toward the deposition of silicon nitride relative to silicon oxide seen in experiments, but not explaining the trends between precursors. Using more realistic cluster models of amine and hydroxyl covered surfaces, the structures and energies were calculated of reaction pathways for chemisorption of different silicon precursors via functional group elimination, with more success. DFT calculations identified the initial physisorption step as crucial toward deposition and this step was thus used to predict the ALD reactivity of a range of amino- silane precursors, yielding good agreement with experiment. The retention of hydrogen within silicon nitride films but not in silicon oxide observed in FTIR spectra was accounted for by the theoretical calculations and helped verify the application of the model.",

It is therefore possible to combine large R groups for volatility with accessible NH groups for adsorption in precursors of the type  $\\mathrm{SiH}_2(\\mathrm{NH}_2)_2$ .

Although DIPAS has only one alkyl amide attached to its central silicon atom, the large iso- propyl groups interact in a similar manner to the alkyl groups of  $\\mathrm{SiH}_2\\mathrm{DMA}_2$  and BDEAS creating steric hindrance around the reacting site.",

This retention of hydrogen in silicon nitride films may be explained by looking at the final unbound products (UP) calculated using the proton transfer mechanism described in this work. The molecular structure shown in Figure 12a depicts a  $\\mathrm{SiH}_2\\mathrm{DMA}$  group chemisorbed to a  $(\\mathrm{Si}_3\\mathrm{N}_4)_4(\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O})_{12}$  surface after the elimination of an H- DMA molecule. The new silicon atom from the precursor is bonded to the surface via an oxygen atom which in turn is bonded to a Si atom of the bulk substrate  $(\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{Si})$ , leaving no H atoms coordinated to the oxygen. Though beyond the scope of this paper, which is primarily concerned with the initial adsorption of silane precursors, elimination of the other DMA group as H- DMA may be possible. This process would further deplete the surface of hydrogen and form a second  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{Si}$  bridge.",

However, unlike the  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  model, the nitrogen atom bridging the new silicon atom with the underlying surface has a remaining hydrogen atom  $(\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{NH} - \\mathrm{Si})$  where elimination of the other DMA group would form another  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{NH} - \\mathrm{Si}$  bridge. Further adsorption of a second precursor to bridging NH group and removal of second hydrogen during the silicon precursor ALD pulse is prevented by steric hindrance from the first precursor fragment, particularly in attempting to form the four- membered ring TS (Figure 10). In this way, despite removal of DMA by the nitrogenation pulse (e.g., by treatment with  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  plasma) or by an elimination reaction with neighboring  $\\mathrm{NH}_2$  groups, this NH group will be buried within the film and will remain even after annealing.",

Experiments also show significantly different deposition rates between the precursors employed in the deposition of silicon nitride. To explain these differences, we have applied various theoretical models employing DFT calculations. Thermodynamic models using DFT calculated energies correctly predict the lower reactivity of silicon precursors with amine- terminated surfaces compared to hydroxylated surfaces, but failed to predict the trends in reactivity between precursors. A mechanistic pathway for growth involving the elimination of a precursor functional group via proton transfer mechanism was applied first to small molecules representing surface groups and then to larger cluster models of silicon nitride and silicon oxide surfaces. A significant difference in reactivity is observed because of the orientation of the hydrogen atoms attached to the hydroxyl and amine groups, where in- coming precursors approach the OH group vertically and approach the  $\\mathrm{NH}_2$  group side- on. The nitride surface is therefore considerably more sensitive to precursor bulk.",

        "text": "Though simple thermodynamic models did correctly predict the difference in ALD reactivity between silicon oxides and silicon nitrides they were ineffective in predicting the trends in reactivity between individual precursors. Calculations of the reaction pathway using small gas- phase molecules as models for surface groups were vital in developing a reaction mechanism for adsorption of the precursors and highlighted the importance of the orientation of chemical groups to each other. The significance of this difference in approach of the precursors toward the surface groups becomes apparent when reactivity with the larger cluster models is considered. For the OH- covered surface, little interaction is observed between the precursor and surrounding surface, but for the  $\\mathrm{NH}_2$  covered surface, the side- on approach of the precursor causes the precursor groups to be oriented toward the surface. This has a substantial effect on the strength of the H- bonding between precursor and surface (\"bound reactants\") and thus on the lifetime of the adsorbed state and the probability of further reaction before desorption. Their relative adsorption energetics are therefore used to estimate the ALD kinetics and exposure required. With regard to the silicon dioxide surface model, all the amino- silane precursors considered in this work were determined to have reasonably strongly bound reactants (adsorption energies between  $- 32$  and  $- 65 \\mathrm{kJ / mol}$ ) and therefore a reasonable ALD growth rate is predicted. The steric bulk of the amine functional groups attached to the precursors was found to have a greater effect on ALD growth of silicon nitride.",

By contrast, the same mechanism predicts that hydrogen is only present on the surface of silicon oxide film. In the experimental FTIR absorption spectra, vibrational bands associated with NH bonds in silicon nitride are indeed detected, in contrast with a lack of OH vibrational bands in silicon oxide. This helps validate the proposed growth mechanism and theoretical approach. Due the relative unreactivity of NH groups toward functional group elimination, the plasma assisted ALD silicon nitride is much slower compared to that of silicon oxide systems and requires longer precursor exposure. Targeted reduction in precursor bulk may improve the situation, but the main reason is the inflexible orientation of amine groups at the surface, which is an intrinsic property of the silicon nitride material being deposited.",
