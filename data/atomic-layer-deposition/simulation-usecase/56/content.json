Efficient precursors that enable low- temperature deposition processes are of critical importance to ensure high- quality thin films with low impurity levels. Herein, we present a first- principles study on a full cycle of an ALD process using bis(t- butylamino)silane (BTBAS) as the precursor for developing a  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  thin film on the hydroxylated  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ - (001) surface with ozone as the oxidizing agent. Two possible deposition pathways were systematically studied. One leads to crystalline growth of the film, and the other gives rise to disordered growth layers. Detailed elementary processes on the surface of the substrate and the associated energetics were examined. We show that the crystalline growth pathway is thermodynamically more favorable, but the disordered growth pathway is kinetically more facile. Given enough time to settle, the BTBAS molecule will fully react with the substrate, leaving essentially few impurities on the surface. Our results suggest that BTBAS is a highly efficient precursor for growing dense and conformal  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  thin films with the ALD technique.",

        "text": "Fabrication of silicon dioxide  $(\\mathrm{SiO}_2)$  thin films on device substrates is of essential technological importance for the semiconductor industry. Properly manufactured  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  thin layers exhibit excellent physical and chemical properties, such as optical transparency, chemical inertness, scratch resistance, and hardness. The films can be conventionally deposited on a selected substrate through a variety of techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma- enhanced CVD (PECVD), and so on. As the demand to decrease device sizes continues, the temperature range suitable for thin- film fabrications has become very narrow, and a low- temperature process for  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  deposition is required to ensure excellent device integrity and performance. Although PECVD can produce  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  films at a relatively low temperature  $(< 300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$ , the substrate could be damaged by the use of plasma, and the generated surface impurities could become detrimental to the film quality. On the other hand, miniaturization has produced very high- aspect- ratio structures that need to be coated conformally. Films deposited by CVD might no longer be suitable for nodes with feature sizes below  $20 \\mathrm{nm}$  because of their natural shortcomings in thickness control, uniformity, and conformality. In particular, CVD can reach full coverage only for structures with aspect ratios of less than 10:1. Design and development of novel deposition processes with lower operating temperatures is essential for novel device manufacturing technologies. For the next generation of semiconductor devices, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the preferred method for depositing silicon oxide films at temperature lower than  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . However, the quality of ALD  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  films is largely dictated by the physicochemical properties of the precursors. Bis(t- butylamino)- silane (BTBAS) and other alkylaminosilanes have been used as precursors for  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  film deposition by ALD with ozone as the oxidizing agent. The precursor first undergoes sequential dissociative chemisorption on the hydroxylated  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  surface, leaving a Si atom anchored on the surface as amines are released to the gas phase. Ozone or plasma- activated oxygen is then used to oxidize the surface intermediates to produce hydroxyl groups for subsequent deposition of the next layer.",

In the initial state, BTBAS is adsorbed on the hydroxylated  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2(001)$  surface through a strong H- bond between the N atom of the precursor and a surface H atom. Because the H atom of the O2 site is H- bonded to the O1 type of oxygen atom, the free H atom of the O1 site becomes more reactive to form a H- bond with BTBAS. One would expect the  $\\mathrm{N} - \\mathrm{H}$  distance between BTBAS and the surface to be shorter than for TDMAS because of the stronger electrostatic attraction. Instead, the structural optimization yields a  $\\mathrm{N} - \\mathrm{H}$  distance of  $1.854\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for BTBAS, considerably longer than that for TDMAS  $(1.604\\mathrm{\\AA})$ . Detailed examination of the adsorption structure suggests that the unexpectedly long  $\\mathrm{N} - \\mathrm{H}$  distance results from the steric repulsion between the bulky  $t$ - butylamine group and the surface. As BTBAS comes into contact with the surface, the H atom of the O1- type OH group migrates to the N atom of the precursor as the O1 atom simultaneously attacks the Si atom of the BTBAS molecule. Similarly to the case with TDMAS as the ALD precursor, this process undergoes a transition state with a weakened  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{N}$  bond in the precursor and a significantly elongated  $\\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{H}$  bond on the surface. Here, a four- membered ring is formed, leading to the partial dissociation of BTBAS. As the  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{N}$  distance increases, the  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{O}$  distance is decreased from 3.670 to  $1.720\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . Consequently, a  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{SiNHC}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3$  species is adsorbed on the  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ - (001) surface through a strong  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{O}$  bond, and a  $t$ - butylamine molecule is released into the gas phase. The reaction is thermodynamically favorable, with a calculated reaction energy of  $- 4.4$  kcal/mol. The primary dissociation of BTBAS is also kinetically facile, with a relatively modest activation barrier of  $8.9\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$ . Only a small change in the surface geometry is necessary to accommodate the dissociative chemisorption of BTBAS.",

First, the  $t$ - butylamino group could react with an adjacent OH group to form an  $\\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{SiH}_2 - \\mathrm{O}$  species to maintain its original surface orientation, as shown in Figure 5 (path a). As in step 1, a four- membered ring structure is formed in the course of the dissociation. The calculated main structural parameters are summarized in Table 2. At the transition state, the  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{O}$  distance is longer than the value in step 1 because of the longer initial distance of the attacking OH group, implying that this process might be kinetically unfavorable. Indeed, the calculated activation energy of  $20.1\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  is considerably higher than the value  $(8.9\\mathrm{kcal / mol})$  in step 1 (Figure 3). The association of the Si atom with the adjacent OH group allows the film to grow with the (001) surface orientation, which lowers the surface tension.

As a consequence, this type of bonding network leads to the growth of disordered  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  films. The main optimized structural parameters are listed in Table 2. The transition- state structure along path b  $(\\mathrm{TS}^{\\mathrm{b}})$  consists of a six- membered ring with a  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{O}^{\\mathrm{b}}$  distance of  $2.358\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , which is shorter than the analogous distance along path a  $(2.506\\mathrm{\\AA})$ , indicating that this process is kinetically more facile than path a. Indeed, the calculated activation barrier of  $16.1\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  is lower than the value for path a  $(20.1\\mathrm{kcal / mol})$ . It is worth noting that, after the reaction, a four- membered ring is formed with an unusually short  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{Si}$  distance of  $2.463\\mathrm{\\AA}$ .

        "text": "With the steady miniaturization of electronic devices, demand for thin- film conformity continues to rise, and as a consequence, the temperature window for thin- film fabrication has become increasingly narrow. Conventional thin- film deposition techniques based on CVD or PECVD might not be able to meet the increasingly stringent requirements for the thin- film quality. To this end, ALD has become the method of choice for fabricating dense, conformal thin films with well- controlled thickness and for high- aspect- ratio features. A carefully designed ALD precursor would enable thin- film deposition to be carried out in the desired temperature range with high purity. An understanding of the detailed reaction mechanisms between the precursor and the substrate is essential for the design and discovery of efficient precursors for thin- film fabrication. In this article, we reported a systematic density functional theory study on the detailed mechanisms of a full ALD cycle on the hydroxylated  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  (001) surface to grow  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  films using BTBAS as the precursor and ozone as the oxidizing agent. The ALD process was found to be initiated by the dissociative chemisorption of BTBAS followed by sequential surface reactions and then oxidation by ozone. Two different ALD routes were investigated along their respective minimum- energy pathways. The first route (path a) allows the film to follow the crystalline growth path. It is thermodynamically more favorable but kinetically disadvantageous, with a moderate activation barrier in the second step of precursor surface decomposition. The second ALD route (path b) leads to the growth of a disordered  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  thin film. Although this process was found to be less thermodynamically favorable than the first route, it is kinetically more facile. In practice, it is likely that both growth mechanisms can be operative. Our results suggest that, at higher temperatures, the crystalline growth pattern might prevail because the ALD process will be less sensitive to the kinetics and thermodynamics will dictate the thin- film growth pathways. At lower temperatures, kinetics might become the dominant factor for film growth. As a consequence, the  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  film might become largely disordered.",

        "text": "Our calculations suggest that, overall, the full ALD cycle using BTBAS is thermodynamically exothermic, with modest or moderate activation barriers. Given enough time to settle, the precursor will fully react with the substrate, leaving no impurities on the surface. This is in sharp contrast to the ALD behavior of tris(dimethylamino)silane (TDMAS) for which carbon impurity in the  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  layers is intrinsically inevitable. A recent experiment conducted by Kamiyama et al. made an interesting comparison of the performance of bis(dimethylamino)silane (BDMAS), a precursor with a structure similar to that of BTBAS, and TDMAS for the deposition of  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  films by ALD. It was reported that the film growth rate using BDMAS is 1.5 times the rate with TDMAS. In addition, the carbon impurity level in the film with BDMAS as the precursor was also found to be much lower than that with TDMAS. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. We thus conclude that BTBAS is indeed a superior precursor for  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  thin- film fabrication.",
