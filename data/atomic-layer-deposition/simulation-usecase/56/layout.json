Efficient precursors that enable low- temperature deposition processes are of critical importance to ensure high- quality thin films with low impurity levels.

Given enough time to settle, the BTBAS molecule will fully react with the substrate, leaving essentially few impurities on the surface.

Conventional thin- film deposition techniques based on CVD or PECVD might not be able to meet the increasingly stringent requirements for the thin- film quality. To this end, ALD has become the method of choice for fabricating dense, conformal thin films with well- controlled thickness and for high- aspect- ratio features. A carefully designed ALD precursor would enable thin- film deposition to be carried out in the desired temperature range with high purity. An understanding of the detailed reaction mechanisms between the precursor and the substrate is essential for the design and discovery of efficient precursors for thin- film fabrication. In this article, we reported a systematic density functional theory study on the detailed mechanisms of a full ALD cycle on the hydroxylated "
