<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Fabrication of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) thin films on device substrates is of essential technological importance for the semiconductor industry. Properly manufactured SiO 2 thin layers exhibit excellent physical and chemical properties, such as optical transparency, chemical inertness, scratch resistance, and hardness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The films can be conventionally deposited on a selected substrate through a variety of techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), <ref type="bibr">3À5</ref> and so on. As the demand to decrease device sizes continues, the temperature range suitable for thin-film fabrications has become very narrow, and a low-temperature process for SiO 2 deposition is required to ensure excellent device integrity and performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Although PECVD can produce SiO 2 films at a relatively low temperature (&lt;300 °C), the substrate could be damaged by the use of plasma, and the generated surface impurities could become detrimental to the film quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> On the other hand, miniaturization has produced very high-aspect-ratio structures that need to be coated conformally. Films deposited by CVD might no longer be suitable for nodes with feature sizes below 20 nm because of their natural shortcomings in thickness control, uniformity, and conformality. In particular, CVD can reach full coverage only for structures with aspect ratios of less than 10:1. Design and development of novel deposition processes with lower operating temperatures is essential for novel device manufacturing technologies. For the next generation of semiconductor devices, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the preferred method for depositing silicon oxide films at temperatures lower than 400 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> However, the quality of ALD SiO 2 films is largely dictated by the physicochemical properties of the precursors. Bis(t-butylamino)silane (BTBAS) and other alkylaminosilanes have been used as precursors for SiO 2 film deposition by ALD with ozone as the oxidizing agent. <ref type="bibr">10À12</ref> The precursor first undergoes sequential dissociative chemisorption on the hydroxylated SiO 2 surface, leaving a Si atom anchored on the surface as amines are released to the gas phase. Ozone or plasma-activated oxygen is then used to oxidize the surface intermediates to produce hydroxyl groups for subsequent deposition of the next layer.</p><p>The relative reactivity of precursor dissociative chemisorption is critical in determining the deposition temperature and the ABSTRACT: With the continuing miniaturization of electronic devices, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique has become the preferred choice for the deposition of dense, conformal thin films. Efficient precursors that enable lowtemperature deposition processes are of critical importance to ensure high-quality thin films with low impurity levels. Herein, we present a first-principles study on a full cycle of an ALD process using bis(t-butylamino)silane (BTBAS) as the precursor for developing a SiO 2 thin film on the hydroxylated SiO 2 -(001) surface with ozone as the oxidizing agent. Two possible deposition pathways were systematically studied. One leads to crystalline growth of the film, and the other gives rise to disordered growth layers. Detailed elementary processes on the surface of the substrate and the associated energetics were examined. We show that the crystalline growth pathway is thermodynamically more favorable, but the disordered growth pathway is kinetically more facile. Given enough time to settle, the BTBAS molecule will fully react with the substrate, leaving essentially few impurities on the surface. Our results suggest that BTBAS is a highly efficient precursor for growing dense and conformal SiO 2 thin films with the ALD technique.</p><p>dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp2094802 |J. Phys. Chem. C 2012, 116, 947-952</p><p>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ARTICLE density, purity, and roughness of the thin films. A chemically active precursor allows the deposition to be carried out at a relatively low temperature. The precursor structure, to a large extent, is responsible for the quality of the films. In a previous work, we investigated the dissociative chemisorption on the hydroxylated SiO 2 (001) surface of tris(dimethylamino)silane (TDMAS), which has been used for ALD processes of SiO 2 thin-film growth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The results indicated that sequential dissociation of TDMAS can occur only up to the second step with dimethylaminosilylenyl groups anchored on the surface. Essentially, further dissociation of these surface species was found to be energetically forbidden under typical ALD processing conditions. This would result in an inherently low-density and compositionally impure SiO 2 film with a low deposition rate.</p><p>Because there are only two t-butylamino groups in the BTBAS molecule, its dissociative chemisorption is expected to be more complete than that of TDMAS. We thus anticipated that the use of BTBAS as the precursor would give rise to a denser and purer SiO 2 film. In this article, we present a density functional theory study aimed to understand the mechanism of the full ALD process of BTBAS on a hydroxylated SiO 2 (001) surface using ozone as the oxidizing agent. The reaction pathways and energetic properties of the whole ALD process, including both the BTBAS dissociation and surface regeneration using ozone, were systematically investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">COMPUTATIONAL METHOD</head><p>All calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) with the exchange-correlation functional proposed by Perdew and Wang. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe the core electrons of atoms, and the valence orbitals were represented with a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 396 eV. Electronic energies were calculated with a self-consistent-field (SCF) tolerance of 10 À4 eV. Structural optimizations were performed for all atoms of the initial-, intermediate-, and final-state structures, including the adsorbates but excluding the bottom three layers of the substrate, which were kept fixed throughout, until the total energy of the system converged to within 10 À3 eV. Allowing the atoms of two of the bottom layers to relax resulted in only marginal changes in the surface structure, with the differences in bond lengths and bond angles being less than 0.02 Å and 3°, respectively. Transition-state structures were obtained using the nudged-elastic-band (NEB) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> to calculate the minimum-energy profile along the prescribed dissociation pathways with the initial and final states chosen based on the optimized structures. The number of images was chosen to achieve smooth curves. The Brillouin zone integration was sampled within a 4 Â 4 Â 2 MonkhorstÀPack k-point mesh, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and electron smearing was employed using the MethfesselÀPaxton technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> with a width of 0.1 eV to minimize the errors in the HellmannÀ Feynman forces. All calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> For analysis of electrostatic properties of the BTBAS molecule, we also performed DFT calculations using the same exchange-correlation functional but with a double numerical basis set augmented with polarization functions as implemented in the DMol 3 package of Materials Studio 5.0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Usually, SiO 2 surfaces are hydroxylated, which increases their reactivity toward silicon precursors. In the present study, we focused on the growth of SiO 2 thin films by ALD on the fully hydroxylated SiO 2 (001) surface, which is the preferred orientation in amorphous silica. The reconstructed and fully hydroxylated SiO 2 (001) surface was taken from our previous work (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and modeled as a slab containing six alternating layers with two layers of O atoms and one layer of Si atoms. A rectangular surface unit cell was selected with the optimized cell parameters of a = 8.320 Å and b = 9.5 Å. Between the slabs, an approximately 12-Å-thick vacuum gap was inserted to avoid interactions between adjacent slabs. The supercell contained 8 Si atoms, 20 O atoms, and 8 H atoms. The surface was equilibrated prior to precursor adsorption. The main calculated structural parameters were found to be in good agreement with the experimental values and previous DFT calculations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In a previous work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> we identified that there are two types of hydroxyl groups, indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, on the optimized SiO 2 (001) surface. The more exposed type (labeled O1) was found to be more reactive than the embedded one (labeled O2). The higher electron density on O1, coupled with high surface exposure of the atom, makes the O1 sites more accessible for electrophilic attack by precursor molecules. The optimized BTBAS molecule and its electrostatic charge distribution are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Compared with TDMAS, there are only two amino groups in BTBAS, making the Si atom less positively charged (the Mulliken charge on Si is 1.049 e À in BTBAS versus 1.336 e À in TDMAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ). We note that the two N atoms of BTBAS are both more negatively charged than the N atoms in TDMAS (À0.664 e À versus À0.157 e À ) because of the strong electron-donating effect of the t-butyl groups in BTBAS.</p><p>Because of the self-limiting nature of the ALD process, the deposition process was broken into two half-reactions, as shown in Scheme 1. In the first half (Scheme 1a,b), the silicon precursor undergoes a dissociative chemisorption process on the hydroxylated SiO 2 surface, resulting in the anchoring of the Si atom of the precursor on the surface and the release of amines into the gas phase. In the second half-reaction (Scheme 1c), ozone is introduced into the reaction chamber to oxidize the ÀSiH 2 intermediate species on the surface to form ÀSi(OH) 2 groups, thereby completing the deposition of the first SiO 2 layer and getting ready for the next reaction cycle. dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp2094802 |J. Phys. Chem. C 2012, 116, 947-952 The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ARTICLE 3.1. First Half-Reaction: BTBAS Dissociative Chemisorption.</p><p>As shown in Scheme 1, the dissociative chemisorption of BTBAS on the SiO 2 (001) surface can be broken into two sequential steps, each leading to the formation of a SiÀO bond and the release of a t-butylamine molecule. The calculated energy profiles along the prescribed pathways of the first half-reaction are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>For step 1, the optimized structures of the initial, transition, and final states are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, and the corresponding optimized structural parameters are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. In the initial state, BTBAS is adsorbed on the hydroxylated SiO 2 (001) surface through a strong H-bond between the N atom of the precursor and a surface H atom. Because the H atom of the O2 site is H-bonded to the O1 type of oxygen atom, the free H atom of the O1 site becomes more reactive to form a H-bond with BTBAS. One would expect the NÀH distance between BTBAS and the surface to be shorter than for TDMAS because of the stronger electrostatic attraction. Instead, the structural optimization yields a NÀH distance of 1.854 Å for BTBAS, considerably longer than that for TDMAS (1.604 Å). Detailed examination of the adsorption structure suggests that the unexpectedly long NÀH distance results from the steric repulsion between the bulky t-butylamine group and the surface. As BTBAS comes into contact with the surface, the H atom of the O1-type OH group migrates to the N atom of the precursor as the O1 atom simultaneously attacks the Si atom of the BTBAS molecule. Similarly to the case with TDMAS as the ALD precursor, this process undergoes a transition state with a weakened SiÀN bond in the precursor and a significantly elongated OÀH bond on the surface. Here, a four-membered ring is formed, leading to the partial dissociation of BTBAS. As the SiÀN distance increases, the SiÀO distance is decreased from 3.670 to 1.720 Å. Consequently, a H 2 SiNHC(CH 3 ) 3 species is adsorbed on the SiO 2 -(001) surface through a strong SiÀO bond, and a t-butylamine molecule is released into the gas phase. The reaction is thermodynamically favorable, with a calculated reaction energy of À4.4 kcal/mol. The primary dissociation of BTBAS is also kinetically facile, with a relatively modest activation barrier of 8.9 kcal/mol. Only a small change in the surface geometry is necessary to accommodate the dissociative chemisorption of BTBAS. Scheme 1. Proposed ALD Reaction Mechanisms for the (a,b) First and (c) Second Half-Reactions Figure 3. Calculated potential energy profiles along the prescribed pathways of the first half-reaction. The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ARTICLE This concludes the primary step of the dissociative chemisorption of the BTBAS molecule.</p><p>Prior to the secondary dissociative chemisorption of BTBAS, which occurs in a similar fashion to the primary step, the surface species must reorient itself to adopt an optimal conformation to interact with the neighboring hydroxyl group of type O2. There are two possible reaction sites for the secondary dissociation of the surface species. First, the t-butylamino group could react with an adjacent OH group to form an OÀSiH 2 ÀO species to maintain its original surface orientation, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> (path a). As in step 1, a four-membered ring structure is formed in the course of the dissociation. The calculated main structural parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. At the transition state, the SiÀO distance is longer than the value in step 1 because of the longer initial distance of the attacking OH group, implying that this process might be kinetically unfavorable. Indeed, the calculated activation energy of 20.1 kcal/mol is considerably higher than the value (8.9 kcal/mol) in step 1 (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The association of the Si atom with the adjacent OH group allows the film to grow with the (001) surface orientation, which lowers the surface tension. Indeed, the calculated thermochemical energy of À13.6 kcal/mol indicates that the reaction is thermodynamically favorable. The optimized SiÀOÀSi and OÀSiÀO angles in the top surface layer are 145.0°and 103.2°, respectively, close to the corresponding values in the SiO 2 single crystal (143.0°and 109.8°, respectively). The reaction results in the formation of a SiH 2 species on the SiO 2 (001) substrate with the preserved (001) surface orientation and the release of a second t-butylamine to the gas phase.</p><p>Alternatively, the SiH 2 species can also undergo another route, with the t-butylamino group being attacked by the OH group on the same substrate Si atom, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5 (path b</ref>). This bonding configuration represents a deviation from the (001) orientation of the SiO 2 substrate, because the (001) crystalline surface requires the O atoms that form bonds with a Si atom come from nearest-neighbor Si atoms. As a consequence, this type of bonding network leads to the growth of disordered SiO 2 films. The main optimized structural parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. The transition-state structure along path b (TS b ) consists of a six-membered ring with a SiÀO b distance of 2.358 Å, which is shorter than the analogous distance along path a (2.506 Å), indicating that this process is kinetically more facile than path a. Indeed, the calculated activation barrier of 16.1 kcal/mol is lower than the value for path a (20.1 kcal/mol). It is worth noting that, after the reaction, a four-membered ring is formed with an unusually short SiÀSi distance of 2.463 Å. As a consequence, the structure of the final product (P b ) exhibits a strong geometric strain with an OÀSiÀO angle of 85.5°, which deviates significantly from the typical angle of 109.8°expected for sp 3 hybridization. The highly stressed optimized structure indicates that the structure could be thermochemically unstable (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Indeed, this process was found to be modestly endothermic, with a reaction energy of 1.7 kcal/mol. It is interesting to note that, despite the strong stress of the local bonding area, only slight surface relaxation was found in the rest of the surface upon the second-step reaction.</p><p>3.2. Second Half-Reaction: Surface Oxidation. To grow SiO 2 films by ALD, surface OH groups need to be regenerated for the next reaction cycle. Ozone is often used to oxidize the surface ÀSiH 2 species formed in the first half-reaction. Because there are two different types of SiH 2 species using BTBAS as the precursor, the oxidation process can also progress along two reaction pathways, which turn out to be very similar, with one O atom of the ozone molecule attacking the positively charged Si atom of the surface ÀSiH 2 species, resulting in a surface ÀOH species and an O 2 molecule in the gas phase.</p><p>For the ÀSiH 2 species with the same orientation as the SiO 2 -(001) surface (path a), the calculated structures of the initial, transition, and final states of the two sequential reaction steps are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, and the main optimized bond parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. In the first step (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>), both the SiÀH a and O b ÀO c bonds are weakened as the SiÀO c distance decreases.   The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ARTICLE A triangular structure is then formed at the transition state (O c ÀSiÀH a ) to minimize the activation energy. At the final state, both the SiÀH a bond and O b ÀO c bond are broken, leading to ÀOH formation and O 2 release. The oxidation process is strongly exothermic, with a moderate activation barrier of 17.7 kcal/mol (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>). A similar oxidation reaction with O 3 subsequently takes place to oxidize another SiÀH bond into SiÀOH. The calculated geometries are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>, and the associated bond parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. We note that, in the initial state, the calculated SiÀO c distance is considerably longer than the value in step 1 because the OH group formed in the first step prevents the ozone molecule from getting closer to the target Si atom. However, at the transition state, the two OH groups on the Si atom form two hydrogen bonds, with calculated distances of 2.393 and 2.853 Å, respectively. The H-bonding formed at the transition state effectively lowers the activation barrier by 2.3 kcal/mol compared to the first oxidation step; however, unlike the first oxidation step, it is the main driving force for the second oxidation step. At the final product state, two OH groups are formed with an OÀSiÀO angle of 107.8°, very close to the value in the pure substrate. Again, the process is strongly exothermic, with a calculated thermochemical energy of À85.5 kcal/mol. The oxidation process for path b, which leads to the disordered surface, is virtually identical to the reactions discussed above. The optimized structures of the initial, transition, and final states are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. The calculated bond parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Compared with path a, the SiÀO distance at the initial state is much shorter owing to the highly exposed SiÀH bonds     The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ARTICLE because of the strained substrate structure along the disordered growth pathway. This leads to more favorable kinetic processes for the oxidation. Indeed, the calculated activation energy of the primary oxidation (step 1) is significantly lower than the value along path a (5.2 versus 17.7 kcal/mol). For the secondary oxidation, the calculated activation barrier of 4.9 kcal/mol is also quite modest. Again, the low activation energy results from not only the exposed SiÀH bond but also the H-bonding with the calculated H-bond distances of 3.518 and 2.804 Å between the two OH groups. The surface is fully hydroxylated upon full oxidation, which is then ready for the next ALD cycle to grow the SiO 2 film.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">SUMMARY</head><p>With the steady miniaturization of electronic devices, demand for thin-film conformity continues to rise, and as a consequence, the temperature window for thin-film fabrication has become increasingly narrow. Conventional thin-film deposition techniques based on CVD or PECVD might not be able to meet the increasingly stringent requirements for the thin-film quality. To this end, ALD has become the method of choice for fabricating dense, conformal thin films with well-controlled thickness and for high-aspect-ratio features. A carefully designed ALD sor would enable thin-film deposition to be carried out in the desired temperature range with high purity. An understanding of the detailed reaction mechanisms between the precursor and the substrate is essential for the design and discovery of efficient precursors for thin-film fabrication. In this article, we reported a systematic density functional theory study on the detailed mechanisms of a full ALD cycle on the hydroxylated SiO 2 (001) surface to grow SiO 2 films using BTBAS as the precursor and ozone as the oxidizing agent. The ALD process was found to be initiated by the dissociative chemisorption of BTBAS followed by sequential surface reactions and then oxidation by ozone. Two different ALD routes were investigated along their respective minimum-energy pathways. The first route (path a) allows the film to follow the crystalline growth path. It is thermodynamically more favorable but kinetically disadvantageous, with a moderate activation barrier in the second step of precursor surface decomposition. The second ALD route (path b) leads to the growth of a disordered SiO 2 thin film. Although this process was found to be less thermodynamically favorable than the first route, it is kinetically more facile. In practice, it is likely that both growth mechanisms can be operative. Our results suggest that, at higher temperatures, the crystalline growth pattern might prevail because the ALD process will be less sensitive to the kinetics and thermodynamics will dictate the thin-film growth pathways. At lower temperatures, kinetics might become the dominant factor for film growth. As a consequence, the SiO 2 film might become largely disordered.</p><p>Our calculations suggest that, overall, the full ALD cycle using BTBAS is thermodynamically exothermic, with modest or moderate activation barriers. Given enough time to settle, the precursor will fully react with the substrate, leaving no impurities on the surface. This is in sharp contrast to the ALD behavior of tris(dimethylamino)silane (TDMAS) for which carbon impurity in the SiO 2 layers is intrinsically inevitable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> A recent experiment conducted by <ref type="bibr">Kamiyama et al. 11</ref> made an interesting comparison of the performance of bis(dimethylamino)silane (BDMAS), a precursor with a structure similar to that of BTBAS, and TDMAS for the deposition of SiO 2 films by ALD. It was reported that the film growth rate using BDMAS is 1.5 times the rate with TDMAS. In addition, the carbon impurity level in the film with BDMAS as the precursor was also found to be much lower than that with TDMAS. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. We thus conclude that BTBAS is indeed a superior precursor for SiO 2 thin-film fabrication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
