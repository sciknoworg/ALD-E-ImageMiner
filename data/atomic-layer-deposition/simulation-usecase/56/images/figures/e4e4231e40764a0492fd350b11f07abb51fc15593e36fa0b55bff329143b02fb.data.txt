| Step | Description |
|---|---|
|R1 | Initial state of the reaction, showing the reactants and their arrangement around the silicon atom. |
|TS1 | Transition state of the reaction, where the hydrogen atoms are moving towards the oxygen atoms. |
|P1 | Product state of the reaction, showing the new arrangement of atoms after the reaction has occurred. |
|R2 | Initial state of another reaction, similar to R1 but with different starting configuration. |
|TS2 | Transition state of the second reaction, showing the movement of hydrogen atoms towards oxygen atoms. |
|P2 | Product state of the second reaction, showing the final arrangement of atoms. |
