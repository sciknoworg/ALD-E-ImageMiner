The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between plasma exposure time and contact resistance for different plasma treatments. The O₂ Plasma ALD shows the highest initial contact resistance, which decreases significantly over time. H₂ Plasma ALD and H₂ Plasma PVD also show a decrease in contact resistance with increasing plasma exposure time, though their rates of decrease appear slower compared to O₂ Plasma ALD.
