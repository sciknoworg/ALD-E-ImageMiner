The chart displays the density of states (DOS) for three different graphene structures: free-standing, hydrogenated, and graphene oxide, both with and without a Pt top-contact. Each structure's DOS is broken down by orbital type (s, px+py, pz) for carbon atoms and s orbital for hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
