The chart illustrates a timeline of computational methods across different time scales, starting from structural optimization in Ab Initio Mechanics at 10^-14 seconds, moving through kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method at 10^-7 seconds, and ending with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) at 10^-3 seconds. It also shows the progression from mesoscopic modeling to macroscopic modeling.
