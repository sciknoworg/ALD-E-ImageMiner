The flowchart illustrates a computational workflow involving multiple models: a macroscopic CFD model using ANSYS Fluent, a mesoscopic kMC model using Python script, and a multiscale model implemented in Linux script. The process includes inputs, intermediate steps like surface pressure and temperature, and outputs.
