Annular reaction zones and asymmetrical inlets enhanced uniform exposure to reagents and minimized reagent intermixing, which allowed the reactor to tolerate higher rotational speeds. Additionally, low rotation speeds and high species mole fractions were required for complete deposition of a cycle of the ASALD process.

The semiconductor industry is now presumably on the verge of entering the 3- nm process era [2,3], thereby meeting the projections of Moore's Law. To further miniaturize and improve nanochip performance, the stacking of transistors to assemble elaborate three- dimensional (3D) structures is being implemented in nanodevices [4], and the number of levels of stack is increasing significantly [5]. However, chipmakers are facing a challenge where vertically stacked features are often displaced from their original positions as the feature sizes of electronic devices continue to shrink [6]. To maximize chip performance, device features on 3D structures must be positioned with extreme precision in the nanoscale, which poses an obstacle for transistor assemblage. If devices are not aligned properly and features are not placed in precise locations, it may lead to a misalignment or an edge placement error (EPE) [7]. The misalignment of features in 3D semiconductor chip stacks needs to be resolved, as this issue also causes structures to be deformed [8,9]. Structure deformation disrupts the flow of electric currents, further increasing the likelihood of chip failure [10]. It has been reported that these misalignment issues are associated with the conventional top- down fabrication methodology of using a series of deposition, lithography, and etching processes [11].

In this bottom- up synthesis method, molecules are scaled up to build nanoscale features from reactive precursors in a self- aligned manner that requires energetically favorable operating conditions [13] and low surface defect densities [14] to yield anisotropic layering. However, the generation of self- aligned structures allows for greater control over the morphologies of the patterned surface and reduces EPEs while enabling smaller feature sizes for wafers [15]. Currently, self- assembled nanostructures are constructed using lithographic techniques [16] to generate templates preceding thin- layer deposition to promote nanopatterning [17] in this bottom- up approach. Recently, researchers have focused on self- assembling nanostructures such as [18] who studied the chemoselective nature of a chemical inhibitor on chemically similar metal- oxides and [19] who proposed a new precursor passivation technique that was beneficial for promoting higher controllable surface morphologies. In particular, a nanowire, as a high aspect- ratio component of a transistor [20,21] that is capable of being synthesized in one- dimensional (1D) structures [11], has been recognized for its potential to fabricate gate- all- around (GAA) transistors [22]. Apart from self- assembly, the bottom- up process is leveraged by a nonlithographic technique proposed in [23] and demonstrated in [24]. This emerging technology is conducive toward reducing manufacturing costs [25], eliminating lithography- related processes, and therefore, minimizing toxic reagents [26] that are used in nanoimprint lithographic methods [27]. Area- selective atomic layer deposition (ASALD) is a promising candidate as a bottom- up fabrication process that addresses the challenges of limiting multilayer stacking [26]. ASALD is a technique that locally deposits materials on the growth area (GA), enabling self- aligned fabrication by reducing EPEs [28,29]. To achieve area- selective atomic layer deposition, it is essential to protect the top surface of the non- growth area (NGA) with surface modifying reagents or inhibitors. In this manner, inhibitors passivate the surface of the NGA by creating protective layers to hinder ALD growth on the NGA. Thus, ALD growth is permitted only on the GA in chemoselective and regioselective behaviors. Inhibitor selection obviously plays an essential role to accomplish successful area- selective ALD, and several, long, aqueous polymeric chain inhibitors have been experimented, such as octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) [28,30] and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [31]. Additionally, gaseous small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) have been explored as a promising method [9,32] since the degradation of protective coatings is insignificant, and SMI- based ASALD is readily integrated with various vapor- phase ALD reactions [33]."

Even though experimental approaches are of value, not only are those experiments costly and time- consuming, but in situ monitoring is also restricted, resulting in a lack of spatiotemporal data. in silico studies using multiscale modeling addresses these issues by simultaneously analyzing the features of surface kinetics and fluid flow throughout reactors in a cost- effective manner. Therefore, in conjunction with experimental methods, the development of multiphysics models is needed to offer high- fidelity fluid dynamics data and robust guidelines for process operation and control. The study of multiscale modeling is separated into three parts: (1) atomistic- mesoscopic modeling that characterizes the surface reaction mechanism using kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations and ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, (2) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling that produces diverse data sets for multiphysics fluid flow, and (3) the design of optimal control systems that ensures high- quality output and stable operation.

                                    "content": "Recently, there has been growing interest in spatial atomic layer deposition, which is a potential substitute for conventional ALD processes in that it is capable of high- volume manufacturing [35]. This high throughput capability is made possible by the injection of reagents into separate reaction zones within the spatial reactor that are isolated with an inert gas curtain and vacuum zones. Figure 1 depicts the schematic diagram of a sheet- to- sheet spatial ALD reactor configuration where the substrate is transferred between reaction zones that are isolated by inert gases (gas curtain) by a conveyor belt. Due to the spatially separated reaction zones, no lengthy purging steps are required to maintain the self- limiting nature of the reactions. In other words, spatial ALD is able to save a significant amount of purging time, resulting in a high throughput ALD process. There have been various proposals of different spatial ALD reactor configurations. The original concept of a spatial reactor as a roll- to- roll reactor was first proposed in 1977 [36], of which applications were limited to flexible substrates. Afterward, a few sheet- to- sheet designs for solar photovoltaic technology and other applications have been developed and commercialized [37,38]. Recent in silico research into multiphysics simulations have focused on sheet- to- sheet designs to provide valuable insight into a route for further industrialization. For instance, several works have explored the effects of the gap distance, which is the separation distance between the dividers and surface of the substrate in Figure 1, on the flow dynamics [39] as well as reactor operating conditions including pumping pressure and substrate velocity [40,41]. Furthermore, ref [42] examined how precursor flow rates and other process operating parameters impact on transport phenomena and surface reactions. Additionally, prior works [43,44] investigated the effect of the substrate velocity on film uniformity and surface kinetics using a three- dimensional multiscale computational fluid dynamics model. Despite the potential of high- volume production, the sheet- to- sheet reactors weaken in terms of versatile applications since it is impossible to avoid necessitating larger equipment with longer substrates compared to standardized wafers. As another approach, rotary designs have been experimented on a laboratory scale, and they have demonstrated the operational capability to provide uniform film growths [45,46]. Furthermore, the dimensions of rotary designs are comparable to that of stationary ALD reactors. Nevertheless, a few studies have carried out experiments to evaluate the rotary design [46,47]. Moreover, aforementioned in silico studies have solitarily focused on the sheet- to- sheet type reactors, which are significantly different from rotary type reactors in many aspects including transport phenomena, reactor configuration optimization, and control strategies. At this stage, research studies aided by computational fluid dynamics simulations are needed to thoroughly investigate the surface kinetics in conjunction with the fluid dynamics of rotary designs."

Additionally, multiscale models are capable of modeling through various time and length scales, as illustrated in Figure 2. In this work, a multiscale model is developed by integrating an atomistic- mesoscopic and a macroscopic simulation that are conjoined by a data- sharing programming methodology. This new model operates without requiring robust computational resources through appropriate process assumptions and simplifications, and provides an accurate representation of realistic phenomena encountered in industrial settings that have been incorporated into this work."

For the purposes of this work, the atomistic- mesoscopic model will be referred to as the mesoscopic model for simplicity. The mesoscopic model conjoins first principles ab initio quantum mechanics (e.g., Density Functional Theory and Nudged Elastic Band) and statistical mechanics (e.g., Transition State Theory and Collision Theory) to evaluate reaction rate constants that will be integrated into a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to monitor the surface kinetics. While the mesoscopic simulation records the evolution of surface kinetics, a macroscopic model is needed to examine the continuum mechanics in the ambient fluid conditions. A three- dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is employed to observe the spatiotemporal behavior of the species and fluid dynamics in a reaction chamber through a rigorous process of reactor optimization, mesh discretization, and tailoring the macroscopic model to the ASALD reactor (e.g., boundary conditions, user- defined functions, numerical solver methods, and operating conditions). From the development of the mesoscopic and macroscopic domains, the simulations are conjoined by linking the surface partial pressure data evaluated from the macroscopic CFD model to the kMC simulation, which successively evaluates the source accumulation rates of species for a time progression to be defined to the macroscopic CFD model. Thus, a multiscale model is intimately constructed that enables the simultaneous modeling of surface kinetics and continuum mechanics in a spatiotemporal manner, which is depicted by the process diagram in Figure 3."

The NEB approach is a transition- path sampling procedure that identifies saddle points to determine the minimum energy path between the reactant(s) and product(s) by generating a user- defined number of images of the conversion and atomic movement for each molecular structure [54]. Although a higher number of images (intermediate transition states with minimum energy path) is essential for computing molecular properties of high fidelity, such a simulation will require greater computational resources to complete in ample time as well; therefore, a total of nine images were used in a prior work [34] with results that were verified to experimentally recorded data results observed by [9,33,50]. Once all the intermediate images are produced along with the saddle point, the maximum energy peak is determined, which is utilized to compute the activation energy for the forward and reverse reactions. With the activation energy, the reaction rate constant for each nonadsorption reaction is calculated with the Arrhenius equation, which is shown below:"

When these two molecules adsorb to an active site on their respective substrates, the adsorbates are bulky that they inhibit adjacent active sites from properly binding to other molecules, thereby generating atomic vacancies. Thus, the kMC algorithm must be modified to account for these physical limitations by exercising a novel methodology that simulates hindered sites. In a prior study, ref [34] performed this modification to the kMC algorithm by modeling the adsorption of individual Hacac and BDEAS molecules by considering their orientations on the site of adsorption, which is integrated into the multiscale modeling framework in this work."

First, reactor configurations are assembled through computer aided design (CAD) software. The configurations are optimized computationally through a mesh of reasonable quality which ensures lower simulation times and higher substrate quality. Once the reactor model is fully developed, the simulation is tailored to the ASALD process environment by customizing various solver, physics, and personalized settings such as boundary conditions, numerical solver methods, convergence criteria, user- defined functions, materials, fluid dynamics conditions, and remeshing methods. This section will discuss the various settings that are integrated into the macroscopic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation."

Mesh discretization is conducted to obtain numerical solutions by adopting the finite volume method, and has a significant impact on the accuracy of the solution. Tetrahedral elements are chosen as they are recommended for 3D geometries by providing high mesh convergence. For mesh sizing, proximity, and curvature, refinements are conducted to capture more accurate flow profiles in thin reactor configurations. In addition, the face mesh of the outlets (i.e., vacuum ports) is enhanced through face meshing controls to determine the suitable divisions of the face mesh. To capture the motion of the rotating boundaries, the dynamic mesh model is necessary for modeling flow dynamics spatiotemporally. This feature facilitates the process for updating the volume mesh while preserving the quality of the mesh. The mesh quality of the reactor configurations that are developed in this paper is summarized in Table 1. The constructed meshes are qualified for CFD simulations in accordance with the standardized ranges provided by [61]."

However, some thermodynamic properties of the reagents, including Hacac and BDEAS, are limited in literature and experimental data; thus, ab initio quantum mechanics simulations are performed to compute the thermophysical parameters (enthalpy of formation, entropy of formation, specific heat at constant pressure) for materials with insufficient data. Quantum ESPRESSO contains programs dedicated to evaluating material properties using density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with the Quasi Harmonic Approximation (QHA), which is integrated to evaluate the material properties. The computed thermophysical properties were cross- validated with literature results for some properties via the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database for Hacac and by comparison to similar molecules such as bis(dimethylamino)silane (BDMAS) for BDEAS. Additionally, properties including the thermal conductivity and the viscosities were also defined to each gaseous species. The thermal conductivities of each gas- phase species were approximated to that of air, which is composed of nitrogen and oxygen gas, and is similar to the composition of the species in the reactor. The viscosities of each for species not available in the Ansys Fluent database were obtained through material safety data sheets (MSDS) available online. As summarized in Table 2, these thermophysical properties are then defined into the macroscopic simulation on Ansys Fluent for a reference temperature of "

Spatiotemporal numerical solutions for each node in the mesh are computed with the pressure- based coupled solver provided by Ansys Fluent, which simultaneously solves the mass and momentum continuity equations, Equations (8) and (9), with greater computational efficiency and convergence speed compared to the segregated pressure- based solver approach. To model the temporal dynamics, a transient solver method is proposed by adopting a first- order implicit formulation with a fixed 0.001 s time interval. Although higher order methods could have been employed to reduce the global error induced from the numerical method, the first- order implicit method was chosen to lessen the overall computation time of the process while preserving convergence criteria. Lastly, the Gauss- Seidel iterative method is utilized to solve algebraic systems by default."

A UDF is a function that is able to enhance CFD simulations by customizing boundary conditions, defining material properties, and even initializing simulations, for instance. In this study, several UDFs are utilized to define mass flow rates and reagent mole fractions, source terms for species generation and consumption, temperature, the motion of the wafers with respect to the reactor, and allocating indexes in User- Defined Memories (UDMs). UDMs allow Ansys Fluent to find the appropriate nodes for computing reagent consumption and byproduct generation. Additionally, wafers are radially sliced into 10 equiangular sections so that mesoscopic simulations are executed in parallel, as shown in Figure 6. Thus, 10 mesoscopic simulations are conducted on each wafer, and the coverage on the 10 sections of a wafer from the mesoscopic simulation is computed as an area- weighted average. Given that 3 wafers are equipped in a spatial reactor, 30 UDMs must be applied to specify the nodes in which the consumption and generation of species take place."

However, the computation efficiency (e.g., computational burden and time) heavily relies on computing resources. For example, to reduce numerical errors, high- order numerical methods with extremely fine meshes increase computing costs. Therefore, appropriate size of the mesh elements and numerical methods should be employed. In this study, 36- core dual processors with 384 GB of RAM (Random- Access Memory) are utilized to simulate the multiscale CFD model."

Depending on reactor geometry and design, the exposure time may vary across the surface of the wafer. Thus, it is vital to examine the distribution of exposure times for various reactors and ensure a tight distribution of exposure times. For a spatial reactor, the exposure time for a specific point is determined not by the gas distribution device, but rather by the shape of the reaction zones where the substrate enters by the rotation of the bottom plate. To investigate the effect that reaction zone configurations have on the exposure time distribution, steady- state and dynamic simulations of R1, which has circular reaction zones, and R4, which has annular- sectioned reaction zones, were performed with a reactant mole fraction of 0.1 and with an angular velocity of "

This data was then used to determine how long each wafer node spent saturated with Hacac, which is the exposure time. After being processed, all the nodal data was plotted in Figure 8c,d, and the wafer surface contours for all nodes are shown in Figure 9a,b. Results suggest that the geometry of the reaction zones for R1 and R4, which are presented in Figure 5a,d, respectively, directly affect the distribution of nodal exposure time."

However, the proposed circular spatial reactor differs from a linear sheet- to- sheet reactor in that the wafers are rotating in an angular fashion around the reactor, causing the edge of the wafer that is furthest from the center of the reactor to be traveling at a faster tangential velocity. Thus, to ensure that each point of the wafer spends the same amount of time in the reaction zone, the ideal reaction zone shape must consist of arc lengths that are solely dependent on their radial distance from the center of the reactor. This condition is best fulfilled by the annular- sectioned reaction zones of reactor R4. For reactor R1, however, the central region of the substrate is expected to have longer exposure times compared to that of the outer region of the substrate due to the round reaction zone, which is easily demonstrated by examining the point on the wafer that is the furthest from the center of the reactor. This point will only be present in the reaction zone for a short time"

This large difference in standard deviation between the two reactors aligns with the predicted result, and it demonstrates that the standard deviation of the exposure times on the wafer is directly correlated to the shape of the reaction zones. To produce films with high uniformity, the reactor must have reaction zones shaped like annular sections as shown in R4."

This phenomenon is named intermixing, and preventing it is vital to ensure uniform film growth. Intermixing is mainly caused by the substrate physically dragging unreacted reactants into the purge zone, which means that it is correlated to three features of reactor design: the gap distance, the wafer velocity, and the vacuum pressure. As intermixing is a binary criterion in that it is either present or is not, it is best to first determine the domain in which no intermixing is present before identifying other criteria such as fastest computational speed or fastest processing speed to select the optimal reactor design."

However, the curves for BDEAS appear discontinuous, which is attributed to its proposed kinetic mechanism. An observable limitation of the kMC method is that the algorithm requires a priori knowledge of a reaction mechanism [69] that, if exceedingly simplified, will reduce the accuracy of the kMC model when trying to predict realistic surface kinetics. Figure 11b exemplifies a noncompetitive BDEAS adsorption in which desorption and intermediate pathways are not immediately observed after the adsorption reaction takes place. This work utilized a kinetics mechanism determined by [33] with large activation energy differences that were evaluated using the nudged elastic band method by [34]. Such reaction mechanism introduces a spontaneous reaction path where the surface coverage is dictated by the large reaction rate constant differences that generate this noncompetitive kinetics mechanism, where one reaction path dominates. Additionally, the repulsive forces due to the steric effects reduced the versatility of pursuing intermediate or reverse reaction paths, therefore, producing steeper coverage curves."

Due to the fixed rotation speed imposed to the three wafers, the equal areas of each wafer are exposed to each reagent as shown in Figure 14a. However, the reaction progression for each reaction, which is inspected by measuring the generation of byproducts from the wafer surface, is different as revealed in Figure 14b–d. As discussed above, BDEAS adsorption requires higher mole fraction and lower rotation speeds to achieve complete coverage compared with Hacac and ozone adsorption. Despite the fact that more than half of the wafer area is in the BDEAS- enriched reaction zone (in Figure 14c), the byproduct, DEA, is only observed in a small area, which is the area that first encountered the reagent due to the BDEAS adsorption mechanism, and the steric effects discussed in Section 2.2.

Since the BDEAS reaction takes longer time, a higher mole fraction for BDEAS than the ones for Hacac and ozone is required to obtain full coverage at the same wafer rotation speed. Due to the advantage of this modeling study that can generate a broad set of data at varying operating conditions, this in silico work has the potential to expedite reaction scale- up in industry. Therefore, this modeling approach offers insights and data to process engineers to select proper operating conditions for further process development. On top of that, this study presents guidelines to design and optimize a rotary type spatial reactor in an industrial setting. Finally, as described in Section 1, further research is needed to design an optimal control system for robust process operation. Specifically, given the complexity of the reaction taking place inside these reactors, advanced control methods for ASALD (e.g., model predictive control, artificial neural network- based run- to- run control) can be developed in a future work to ensure robust process operation."
