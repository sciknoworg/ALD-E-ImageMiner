The Raman spectroscopy charts display the normalized intensity of various treatments applied to a sample at different Raman shifts. The treatments include 'Pristine', 'Al₂O₃ ALD', 'O₂ Plasma', 'H₂ Plasma', and '400°C Anneal'. Each treatment shows distinct peaks at specific Raman shifts, indicating changes in the sample's structure.
