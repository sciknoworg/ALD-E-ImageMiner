The bar chart compares the mobility (cm²/V·s) of different treatments across three categories: Pristine, O₂ Plasma30s, and H₂ Plasma 35s. The treatments include Pristine state, Plasma Treatment, Al₂O₃ ALD, and 400°C Anneal. The highest mobility is observed under 400°C Anneal treatment across all categories.
