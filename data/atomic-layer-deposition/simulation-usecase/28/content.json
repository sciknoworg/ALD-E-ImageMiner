        "text": "A mechanism of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  film growth in an ALD reactor from metal chlorides and water vapor is proposed to explain the experimentally observed features of the process: the formation of less than one monolayer per cycle and the dependence of the film growth rate (mass or thickness increment per cycle) and the residual chlorine concentration on the process temperature. Energy parameters of the relevant gas- surface reactions are estimated from quantum- chemical density functional theory calculations. The rate constants of the elementary reactions are calculated using RRKM theory. ALD process simulations, based on the proposed mechanism and a transient plug- flow reactor model, are consistent with the available experimental data, indicating a decrease in deposition rate with increasing temperature. The reduction in deposition rate is attributed to the increased dehydroxylation of the film surface as the temperature is increased. The  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  adsorption energy was found to increase with increasing dehydroxylation from 33 to  $53\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  for  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and from 35 to  $51\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ . A kinetic Monte Carlo model of film growth, based on the proposed mechanism, describes the observed temperature dependence of the residual chlorine concentration in the film in terms of the steric repulsion between chemisorbed surface groups and adsorbed  $\\mathrm{MCl_4}$  molecules  $(\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{Zr},\\mathbf{Hf})$ .",

It was shown that at low temperatures the ALD method produced uniform amorphous films. However, these films were of low density and were highly contaminated with chlorine atoms. The subsequent annealing, commonly used to densify the films and to remove contaminations, leads to the formation of polycrystalline structures, which often suffer from high leakage current densities. Films grown at higher temperatures had a low chlorine contamination, but even as- deposited films were polycrystalline in this case. Hence, a fundamental understanding of the chemistry and kinetics of oxide film growth in an ALD reactor is of primary interest and importance in order to find the best conditions for obtaining high- quality films.",

It is reasonable to assume that a Cl atom becomes stronger bound to the surface as the number of the nearest neighboring metal atoms increases and, hence, the number of short M- Cl contacts also increases. In this case, the activation energy of possible reactions between water and chemisorbed chlorine will also increase. Steric hindrances from neighboring chemisorbed surface groups will act in the same direction. Therefore, as the film grows, the reaction of water with a chemisorbed chlorine atom will slow down. This effect results in the fact that the residual chlorine concentration is not described by Eq. (7) and the chlorine atoms can be can be readily captured in the growing film.

The behavior of curves reflects the fact that an increase in the temperature of the  $\\mathrm{ZrCl_4}$  effusion cell from 145 to  $160^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  leads to an increase in the precursor flow rate by a factor of  $\\sim 5$ .

First, the minimum mechanism neglects surface diffusion processes, which may be important in the water desorption mechanism. This assumption is valid only at high surface hydroxylation degrees. However, at low coverages, dehydroxylation is controlled by two processes: the diffusion- assisted reaction of hydroxyl groups to form a pre- desorption complex and the decomposition of this complex to desorb water. The first process is of the second order with respect to the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups, whereas the second one is of the first order. Depending on the reaction parameters and the hydroxylation degree, the overall rate of surface dehydroxylation can be limited by either process. It can, in its turn, affect the overall growth rate in the high temperature region, where the coverage decreases with increasing temperature. Second, the minimum mechanism cannot explain the experimental fact of the change in the Cl:M ratio  $(x)$  in the chemisorbed  $\\mathrm{MCl}_x$  surface groups from  $x = 2$  to  $x = 3$ , because it operates with a single type of hydroxylated sites, namely,  $\\mathrm{M(OH)_2}$ .",

The main problem in this case is that the incorporation of impurity chlorine atoms in the growing film is mainly determined by their interactions with neighboring metal atoms. In order to describe these interactions correctly, an atomistic model of the growing film capable of describing the local environment of each chlorine atom becomes necessary.",

The first situation corresponds to the reactions of type (13) with the reaction path profile shown in Fig. 4a (right- hand side of the potential curve). These reactions are characterized by a pronounced potential barrier. Therefore, quantum- chemical calculations provide all the necessary information on the energy,  $E_{\\mathrm{f}}$  of the corresponding transition complex and its structure, and standard transition state theory can be used to calculate  $k_{\\mathrm{f}}$  and  $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$  for these reactions. For all the reactions under consideration, our quantum- chemical calculations predict that the fragment  $\\mathrm{H - Cl}$  of the transition complex  $\\mathrm{TC}_{\\mathrm{f}}$  is structurally similar to the product gas molecule. Therefore, by analogy with the loose transition complex  $\\mathrm{TC}_{\\mathrm{ad}}$  (which will be considered below), it was assumed that the escaping fragment  $\\mathrm{H - Cl}$  performs two surface- restricted rotations in addition to vibrations, whose frequencies were determined in the model from quantum- chemical calculations.",
