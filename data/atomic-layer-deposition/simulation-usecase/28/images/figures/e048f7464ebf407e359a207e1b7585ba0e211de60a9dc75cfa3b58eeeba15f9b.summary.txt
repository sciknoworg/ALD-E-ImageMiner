The chart illustrates the relationship between temperature (T., Â°C) and two parameters: mass/thickness increment per cycle (a.u.) and hydroxylation degree (a.u.). The mass/thickness increment decreases as temperature increases, while the hydroxylation degree remains constant at zero across all temperatures shown.
