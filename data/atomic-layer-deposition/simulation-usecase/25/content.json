        "text": "ABSTRACT: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical layer deposition (CLD) are techniques to produce conformal, atomically precise overcoats for materials in gas and liquid phases, respectively. Although it is a challenge to explicitly model ALD/CLD dynamics because of the large timescales involved, a combination of rule- based deposition actions, followed by molecular dynamics relaxations, can capture the net effect of one cycle. For ALD, we developed deposition rules for the trimethylaluminum (TMA)  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  system over  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  substrates. We also explore the CLD system of  $\\mathrm{Al(O - sec - Bu)_3 / H_2O}$  solvated in 2- butanol over an  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  substrate. In contrast to previous studies focusing on ligand exchange reactions, the gas- phase simulations predict that a TMA dissociation mechanism is the dominant growth mode, whereas the CLD simulations show a primary growth mode of deposition through precipitation of species that have already undergone reactions in solution. Together, these modeling results constitute a refinement of preexisting ALD models, leading to more accurate growth rate predictions, as well as a first step toward modeling more challenging liquid- phase processes.",

Other researchers take the macroscopic transport processes into consideration, using Monte Carlo methods, lattice Boltzmann methods, and molecular dynamics (MD). Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is an approach that combines reaction events with different timescales to reveal the evolution of the overall process in time. The lattice KMC (LKMC) method was successfully applied to the modeling of  $\\mathrm{Hf(N(CH_3)_2)_4 / H_2O}$  ALD.28 The LKMC method requires the complete knowledge of reaction pathways, as well as their rate constants, which can be calculated ab initio from transition- state theory and DFT. The KMC algorithm uses this information to simulate the system evolution by randomly executing events at all timescales, with event probabilities proportional to their rate constants. Hu et al.29 presented an alternative strategy that employs classical MD. MD alone cannot model entire ALD cycles because of the limited simulation timescales for large systems, so Hu et al. bypassed this timescale limitation by coupling MD with a set of deposition rules.",

Overall, the combination of MD with rule- based deposition makes a favorable compromise between the computationally intensive explicit modeling of the deposition process with the overly simplified modeling of ALD at a macroscopic scale.

Because of the absence of a purging step in this batch liquid- phase process, stoichiometric amounts of precursor are added to each half cycle to achieve monolayer coverage and to prevent unwanted side reactions and uncontrolled growth. Experimentally, there is a large parameter space to explore, including the quantities of precursor injected per cycle, temperature, and the choice of precursors, substrate, and solvent. There are multiple outputs of interest that may vary nonmonotonically with respect to these inputs, including growth rate, roughness, and film density. To completely explore this space through experiments is challenging, thus we wanted to first identify interesting regimes via modeling the liquid- phase chemical layer deposition (CLD) process.

A characteristic difference in coating a silica substrate compared to alumina was the initial decrease in deposited aluminum, followed by a gradual increase. This trend is explained by Delabie et al. $^{47}$  as a consequence of the inability for  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{CH}_3$  bonds to be hydrolyzed, creating an inert surface area after the first half cycle. As the ratio of aluminum to silicon atoms on the surface gradually increases after further ALD cycles, the inert fraction of the surface decreases and the growth rate increases. However, our inclusion of a silica surface model that forbade the hydrolysis of  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{CH}_3$  bonds led to a very limited decrease over the first two cycles that was not as pronounced as the experimental trend measured by Delabie et al., $^{47}$  suggesting that other effects are perhaps at play.",
