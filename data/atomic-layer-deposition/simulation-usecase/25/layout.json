Although it is a challenge to explicitly model ALD/CLD dynamics because of the large timescales involved, a combination of rule- based deposition actions, followed by molecular dynamics relaxations, can capture the net effect of one cycle. For ALD, we developed deposition rules for the trimethylaluminum (TMA) "

Each sequential gas- surface reactions is referred to as a \"half cycle\", during which excess precursor is pulsed into a chamber under reduced pressure for enough time to allow saturation of the substrate surface through a self- limiting process. Subsequently, unreacted precursor or reaction byproducts are eliminated by purging with an inert carrier. Because of the self- limiting nature of the reaction, the two half cycles leave no more than one monolayer of the material at the surface. This process is then cycled until the appropriate film thickness is achieved.11"

Indeed, the pulsed flow of gases into meter- scale reactors, around millimeter- scaled geometries, leads to chemical reactions between atoms, which aggregate into nanometer- thick films and coat micrometer- scaled pores or particles. The problem of timescale in ALD is perhaps even more acute than that of length scale because a combination of fast (picoseconds- nanoseconds) and slow reactions (microseconds- milliseconds) contributes to the film growth, and the pressure changes as gases are pulsed and purged over second- long timescales."

The KMC algorithm uses this information to simulate the system evolution by randomly executing events at all timescales, with event probabilities proportional to their rate constants. Hu et al.29 presented an alternative strategy that employs classical MD. MD alone cannot model entire ALD cycles because of the limited simulation timescales for large systems, so Hu et al. bypassed this timescale limitation by coupling MD with a set of deposition rules."

Because of the absence of a purging step in this batch liquid- phase process, stoichiometric amounts of precursor are added to each half cycle to achieve monolayer coverage and to prevent unwanted side reactions and uncontrolled growth. Experimentally, there is a large parameter space to explore, including the quantities of precursor injected per cycle, temperature, and the choice of precursors, substrate, and solvent. There are multiple outputs of interest that may vary nonmonotonically with respect to these inputs, including growth rate, roughness, and film density. To completely explore this space through experiments is challenging, thus we wanted to first identify interesting regimes via modeling the liquid- phase chemical layer deposition (CLD) process. This is also, to our knowledge, the first attempt of modeling liquid- phase deposition and as such could have many implications beyond our system of interest."

Still harmonic bonds were used to keep ligands at a fixed distance while allowing them freedom of motion. An interaction potential for the ligand pseudo- atoms was developed such that they would not overlap with other atoms. This is accomplished with a purely repulsive Lennard- Jones potential with a cutoff at its minimum value. The parameters for these potential functions are found in Tables S1 and S2 in the section S2 of the Supporting Information."

The consequences of possibly adding insufficient or excess precursors due to the batch configuration of the liquid- phase experiments required additions to the gas- phase model. In particular, a list had to be used to keep track of the species in solution. The equilibration routine had to analyze the list of species in the solution and the surface and terminated only when no reactions were possible. The species and reactions that were considered are presented in Tables 1 and 2."

Predicted growth and roughness per cycle are plotted in Figure 4 as a function of the ALD cycle. The results are compared to those of Hu et al., which studied the same physical system, and to the experimentally observed growth rate, that is, between 0.9 and 1.1 Å/cycle (yellow zone) (Figure 4A). The increased growth per cycle that we predict relative to Hu et al. was largely a consequence of introducing the dissociation reaction and more closely matched experimental values, suggesting that the dissociation reaction may be an important inclusion to correctly predict experimental results. Our trend for surface roughness is similar to that of Hu et al. as it increased with the number of cycles, which was suggestive of the island- growth mode (Figure 4B)."
