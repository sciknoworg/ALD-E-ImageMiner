The line chart illustrates the growth per cycle and surface roughness over cycles for two methods, CLD and ALD. CLD shows more variability in growth per cycle compared to ALD, which remains relatively stable. Surface roughness increases significantly for CLD across cycles, while ALD maintains a low and consistent value.
