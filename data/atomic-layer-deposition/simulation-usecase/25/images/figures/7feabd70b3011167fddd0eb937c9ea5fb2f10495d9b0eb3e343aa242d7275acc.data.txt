| A | A molecular simulation snapshot showing a mixture of molecules with different sizes and colors representing different types of atoms. The bottom layer appears to contain larger red spheres, possibly representing water molecules, while the top layer has smaller white and yellow spheres, potentially representing solutes or other molecules. |
| B | Similar to A, this section shows a molecular simulation snapshot with a mixture of molecules. The arrangement and color coding suggest a similar composition to A, indicating a possible equilibrium state or a specific condition being studied. |
| C | This section displays a dense molecular simulation snapshot where the molecules are closely packed together. The color distribution suggests a homogeneous mixture, which could represent a liquid phase or a specific concentration of molecules. |
| D | This snapshot shows a molecular simulation with a distinct separation between two phases. The bottom layer contains larger red spheres, likely representing water, while the top layer has smaller white and yellow spheres, indicating a solute or another substance. This could represent a system at a phase boundary or a specific condition like a membrane or interface. |
