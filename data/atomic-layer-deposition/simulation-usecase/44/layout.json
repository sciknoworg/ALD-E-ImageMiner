There is a huge market potential for the application of ALD processing to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), due to the precision attainable with this technique. In contrast to the other techniques tested, ALD allows highly conformal coatings to be deposited on high aspect ratio structures, which are typical of MEMS devices. In fact, a recent report has shown that the tribological characteristics of surfaces can be significantly improved through the use of ALD coatings, due to the highly uniform nature of the deposition.

At the onset, it is important to recognize that we restrict our investigation to modeling only the initial reaction mechanisms. The actual ALD growth mechanism is complicated by competing reactions and significant structural relaxation, as surface coverage increases and subsequent layers are deposited. In fact, the densification processes occurring during ALD thin film growth have been studied by others with Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. The KMC approach is able to capture this behavior, which is accompanied by increasing coordination number of the metal atoms within the deposited film. In addition, the actual growth process depends on the operating conditions and the configurations and densities of surface reactive sites, often leading to amorphous structures and point defects in the deposited film. Due to the high computational cost of first- principle calculations, it is not practical to model all of the features of the ALD growth cycle. Therefore, we focus only on"

The geometry of all four cluster models is optimized without applying boundary constraints. This may underestimate the actual mechanical constraints imposed on the atoms of the cluster, due to binding with the rest of the surface. However, we found that the bonding interactions involved in the surface reactions are sufficiently local and delocalization effects are not significant. As a result, the fully relaxed clusters are sufficient to obtain the relative energies of critical structures for the surface reactions. In addition, we did not observe unrealistic structural reorganization of the cluster models, when compared to their experimental analogues."

Our calculations on the small model (Figure 1a) suggest that in computing the binding energy of the reactant and product complexes, the use of MC1 model chemistry leads to a large BSSE. This is primarily due to the negatively charged O atoms, which borrow the basis functions available on the Ti atom. This leads to a more flexible description of the wave function and ultimately a lower energy of the adsorbed complexes, which can be incorrectly ascribed to an increase in the binding energy. Although the difference between the uncorrected and the BSSE corrected binding energies is rather large in the case of small basis sets, it becomes much smaller by using larger basis sets: "

Geometries were optimized by minimizing the energy to stationary points on the PES. The nature of the calculated structures was verified by subsequent frequency calculations, which also yielded zeropoint energy (ZPE) corrections. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed to examine the reaction path leading down from a transition structure in both directions on the PES to ensure that the transition states connect reactants to products. The normal modes corresponding to the imaginary frequencies of the transition state structures were examined with molecular visualization to verify that the nuclear motion tends to deform the transition state structure along the pertinent reaction coordinate."

Although these reactions are thermodynamically unfavorable, they are still suitable for ALD because of the continuous purge of the gaseous product (HCl). However, the lack of a thermodynamic driving force suggests that the hydroxylation reactions may not be complete (leaving Cl impurities) unless the HCl products are continuously removed from the reactor. Because the product complex is higher in energy than the reactant complex, the reverse exchange reaction features a lower activation barrier than that of the forward hydroxylation reaction. If the adsorbed HCl molecules do not desorb in time or the desorbed HCl molecules readsorb on the surface, the faster reverse reaction can lead to Cl impurities in the film."

If reproducibility is expected, experimental investigations should begin with thoroughly characterized substrates, and the resulting film deposition must be interpreted with respect to both the equilibrium and the kinetic characteristics of the surface reactions. It is important that our DFT results be interpreted within the context of our cluster models. Other factors, not accounted for here, may influence the predicted reaction mechanisms, such as varying surface coverage and adsorbate- adsorbate interactions. In future work, we plan to incorporate our DFT results into larger simulation models, such as with kinetic Monte Carlo."
