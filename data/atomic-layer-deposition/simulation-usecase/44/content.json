Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an ideal candidate for meeting these challenges, enabling thin film growth on various surfaces, ranging from planar substrates to nanoporous materials. The deposition can occur uniformly or may also be patterned on surfaces to create quantum dots (with potential applications as memory devices) or to facilitate the patterning of subsequent layers, such as  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  on a glass substrate. Although ALD was introduced nearly 30 years ago, its utility is growing significantly as desired film thicknesses are shrinking in the electronic materials industry. Valuable film properties, such as excellent conformality, uniformity, and controllability obtained with this technique are now beginning to outweigh the inherent drawback of low deposition rates.",

        "text": "Research groups around the world have just recently begun exploring the properties and potential applications of ALD processing. For instance, within the last year, King and co- workers34 have found that ALD films have enormous potential for attaining high performance photonic crystal structures and optical microcavities. The performance benefits are credited to the highly conformal and uniform coatings achieved during the deposition process. Others have begun experimenting with nanolaminated thin films, synthesized by using alternating precursors during the ALD process. These atomically detailed films have been shown to possess superior characteristics for high-  $\\kappa$  gate- oxide materials, which are commonly used in metal- oxide- semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). There is a huge market potential for the application of ALD processing to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), due to the precision attainable with this technique. In contrast to the other techniques tested, ALD allows highly conformal coatings to be deposited on high aspect ratio structures, which are typical of MEMS devices. In fact, a recent report has shown that the tribological characteristics of surfaces can be significantly improved through the use of ALD coatings, due to the highly uniform nature of the deposition. This is quantified with respect to the debris creation and the stability of the friction coefficient. In other areas,  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  and other metal oxides have been deposited on the surfaces of anodic aluminum oxide membranes by using ALD to modify the surface uniformity, surface chemistry, and selectivity of the pores, and the surface coatings have been shown to be stable up to as much as  $500^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  in some cases. Related to this work, others have found that porous  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  materials can be optimal substrates for biosensing applications. While many other applications of ALD exist, these initial discoveries clearly motivate the need to develop fundamental models and simulation tools to help guide this technique.",

At the onset, it is important to recognize that we restrict our investigation to modeling only the initial reaction mechanisms. The actual ALD growth mechanism is complicated by competing reactions and significant structural relaxation, as surface coverage increases and subsequent layers are deposited. In fact, the densification processes occurring during ALD thin film growth have been studied by others with Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. The KMC approach is able to capture this behavior, which is accompanied by increasing coordination number of the metal atoms within the deposited film. In addition, the actual growth process depends on the operating conditions and the configurations and densities of surface reactive sites, often leading to amorphous structures and point defects in the deposited film. Due to the high computational cost of first- principle calculations, it is not practical to model all of the features of the ALD growth cycle. Therefore, we focus only on",

This leads to a more flexible description of the wave function and ultimately a lower energy of the adsorbed complexes, which can be incorrectly ascribed to an increase in the binding energy.

The reaction mechanism is illustrated in Figure 11. Similar to the first half- reactions on the surface hydroxyl groups,  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  first spontaneously adsorbs on the surface oxygen bridges through a Lewis acid/base interaction between Ti and O. This step is weakly exothermic with an adsorption energy of  $- 4.7\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$ . The adsorbed  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  is then capable of attacking the reactive oxygen bridges. As Ti approaches O, negative charge is transferred from O to Ti with the creation of a  $\\mathrm{Ti - O}$  bond. The accumulation of negative charge on Ti can induce the rehybridization of the Ti group from 5- coordination to 4- coordination, which causes a  $\\mathrm{Ti - Cl}$  bond to break, releasing a negatively charged Cl. Meanwhile, with the electronic charge transfer from O to Ti, the O becomes more electron attractive. This tendency, together with the  $\\mathrm{Si - Cl}$  attraction, induces the electronic charge transfer from Si to O, weakening  $\\mathrm{Si - O}$  bond (closest to the negatively charged Cl). The negatively charged Cl is then capable of attacking the positively charged Si to break the  $\\mathrm{Si - O}$  bond and form a  $\\mathrm{Si - Cl}$  bond. When the system passes through the transition state structure along the reaction coordinate, the structure promptly relaxes by swinging out the Ti group and relaxing the  $\\mathrm{Si - O - Si}$  angle. The energy profile for the reaction above is shown in Figure 12. As noted in the figure, the reaction is exothermic by  $27.9\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  with the activation barrier of  $12.8\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$ . As compared to the exchange reaction of  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  on surface hydroxyl groups, the reaction between  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  and surface oxygen bridges has a similar activation barrier ( $12.8\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  on oxygen bridges versus  $11.9\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  on isolated hydroxyl groups and  $14.3\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  on adjacent hydrogen- bonded hydroxyl groups), but the reaction is much more exothermic.",

However, this conclusion is contrary to the measurements of Kinney and Staley,30 who observe that the siloxane bridges react with  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  more quickly than the hydroxyl groups. We believe that this discrepancy is the result of the experimental conditions used. In the experiments,  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  was filled into a sealed chamber containing the silica sample, and their conclusion was drawn from the FTIR spectrum collected after the reactions reached equilibrium. As the reaction enthalpy ( $\\Delta H_0$ ) for the reaction of  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  on the surface oxygen bridges ( $- 27.9\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$ ) is much more negative than the  $\\Delta H_0$  for the exchange reaction on the hydroxyl groups ( $- 6.5\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  on isolated hydroxyl groups and  $- 3.5\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$  on adjacent hydrogen- bonded hydroxyl groups), the equilibrium constant of the reaction on the oxygen bridges is predicted to be significantly larger than that on the hydroxyl groups. This large difference in equilibrium constants indicates that the extent of reaction on the oxygen bridges is higher than that on the surface hydroxyl groups. Therefore, it is not surprising to observe a larger fraction of oxygen bridges reacted with  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  than surface hydroxyl groups at equilibrium. However, the",
