ALD is well- known to produce conformal, uniform, and pinhole- free thin films across the surface of substrates. Due to these advantages, ALD has found many engineering and biomedical applications. However, drawbacks of ALD should be considered. For example, the reaction mechanisms cannot be thoroughly understood through experiments. Moreover, ALD conditions such as materials, pulse and purge durations, and temperature should be optimized for every experiment. It is practically impossible to perform many experiments to find materials and deposition conditions that achieve a thin film with desired applications. Additionally, only existing materials can be tested experimentally, which are often expensive and hazardous, and their use should be minimized. To overcome ALD limitations, theoretical methods are beneficial and essential complements to experimental data. Recently, theoretical approaches have been reported to model, predict, and optimize different ALD aspects, such as materials, mechanisms, and deposition characteristics. Those methods can be validated using a different theoretical approach or a few knowledge- based experiments. This review focuses on recent computational advances in thermal ALD and discusses how theoretical methods can make experiments more efficient."

ALD originated from two different methods: atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and molecular layering (ML), which were first introduced in the 1970s [2]. ALD then emerged due to the need for precise film thickness on small devices with high aspect ratios [2- 4]. The thin films produced by ALD are deposited using chemical gas or vapor phase species, called precursors, in a cyclic fashion [5]. Thus, ALD is often called an advanced form of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). However, unlike CVD, ALD consists of alternative pulses and purges of the precursors, resulting in deposition of the desired film with an expected thickness and composition [5,6]. Furthermore, ALD is often performed under vacuum and at various ranges of temperatures, from room temperatures up to high temperatures, due to which ALD has a wide temperature window [4]."

During the first half- cycle, the precursor is carried by inert gas and pulsed into the reactor with a determined duration, reacts with the available active sites of the substrate, and is chemisorbed on the surface [5]. In this step, ideally, the precursor saturates the surface through a self- limiting reaction. Then, excess unreacted precursor molecules are purged out of the chamber using inert gas.

The films are also uniform, conformal, and pinhole- free across various substrates, even those with high aspect ratios or complex three- dimensional (3D) structures [43,44]. Additionally, many different metals, oxides, nitrides, sulfides, selenides, tellurides, fluorides, and metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) can be deposited by ALD as long as the associated precursors exist [3,9,10,42,45]. A wide range of temperatures can be used in ALD depending on different properties such as the nature of the materials involved and the final applications. ALD can produce high- quality films even at low substrate temperatures [46]."

Depending on the conditions, a 100- nm thin film with thermal ALD would take around 20 h or more to deposit. Although spatial ALD (SALD) has been developed to overcome this drawback [47], it is a rather new tool and not always accessible. Moreover, SALD can be sensitive to ambient air if performed in open air, highly volatile precursors are needed for SALD, and, still, not many precursors for SALD exist [47]. Before each ALD experiment, all the conditions should be determined to find the optimized ones. Thus, for each ALD experiment, different questions need to be answered:"

Moreover, each experiment should be repeated a few times to validate the results and ensure the reproducibility of the samples. On the other hand, the common precursors for ALD are often expensive, and performing many experiments to tune the conditions is inefficient. Additionally, some of the mechanisms result in hazardous by- products, and it is preferred to reduce the number of experiments. Theoretical modeling is one of the ways to find optimal conditions without performing any experiments, which would tremendously reduce the cost and time associated with those experiments."

The modeling technique varies over multiple scales and is based on the interaction between atoms, molecules, particles, and groups of atoms, also known as functional groups. Here, we present an overview of the common theoretical methods used to model ALD and the insight that can be obtained about the process of ALD from the different types of modeling. Thus, we adopt a reverse engineering approach, where we define various aspects of ALD, describe the experimental procedure used for ALD process development, and describe how modeling and simulation have been used for a proper understanding and improvement of the ALD process. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, different aspects of ALD are briefly introduced and discussed, then the computational methods commonly used for modeling and simulation of ALD are presented, and, finally, recent studies on theoretical approaches to ALD are reviewed."

Experimentalists often focused on one or some of the following areas: precursors, mechanisms happening in an ALD reactor, and deposition characteristics such as temperature window, saturating pulse and purge times, growth rate, composition, morphology, and surface properties of the deposited film. Since conventional ALD is a slow process and due to the disadvantages of SALD mentioned above, many time- consuming and expensive experiments are required to tune an ALD condition for desired applications. Thus, not many of the areas mentioned above would be examined in a single research study, and the researchers usually focus on a few of them when studying ALD systems."

The growth rate is a prime factor in ALD studies since it provides a direct method to understand the amount of time each deposition takes and predict the film thickness before deposition. Thus, the growth rate is often reported for each system under study. In addition, the growth rate is affected by the reactor temperature and pressure, pulse and purge times of the reactants, and the nature of the substrate. The growth rate is often reported as a constant value (the slope of the plot showing film thickness versus the number of cycles); however, some studies reported that the growth rate might change over the number of cycles.

The ALD growth modes are mainly attributed to one of the following modes: Volmer- Weber growth, Frank- van der Merwe growth, and Stranski- Krastanov growth [57,58]. In the Volmer- Weber growth mode, also known as island growth, small clusters or islands are first nucleated on the surface. The reason for island nucleation, in this case, is that the interaction of the adsorbed atoms within themselves is stronger compared with the interaction between the atoms and the substrate. That is, the cohesive force within the atoms is stronger than the surface adhesive force, so the atoms tend to accumulate. Then, those small clusters grow into larger three- dimensional ones and reach each other, covering the whole surface [57]."

That is, the atoms completely cover the surface, producing a complete monolayer before the subsequent layer is formed on top [59]. If both the Volmer- Weber and Frank- van der Merwe growth modes are combined, the growth mode is called Stranski- Krastanov. In the Stranski- Krastanov growth mode, which is the more common growth mode, the film starts to form on the surface of the substrate as a whole layer.

Roughness is a part of surface texture, defined as a measure of waviness or irregularities on the film surface. Mapping technologies such as AFM and optical or contact profilometry can be used to calculate the surface roughness. The surface roughness is significantly affected by the growth mode discussed earlier. For instance, the Volmer- Weber growth mode starts with island nucleation; the islands enlarge over time, and, most likely, their heights become larger than the thickness of one monolayer before they converge. Thus, if the growth follows the Volmer- Weber growth mode, the film is often made of rough layers. However, due to the layer- by- layer nature of the Frank- van der Merwe growth mode, smoother films are produced with this growth mode [57]. Aside from the growth modes, the surface roughness depends on other factors such as crystallinity, film thickness, and the nature of the substrate."

Since deposition in ALD happens through surface- controlled reactions, the thin films formed have excellent conformality. That is, the step coverage provided by ALD to the surface of complex structures is higher than that of conventional deposition processes such as CVD and physical vapor deposition (PVD). Conformality is a significant aspect, especially when there is a great desire to coat a complex three- dimensional nanostructured surface or substrates with high aspect ratios [63]. Recently, Cremers et al. [63] provided an extensive review of different aspects of our current knowledge about conformality in ALD processes."

One of the terms in ALD studies is the temperature window, defined as the temperature range over which the self- controlled growth would occur at a constant rate. Inside the ALD window, the growth rate would change significantly with an increase in the temperature due to the physisorption/condensation of precursors on the surface or low reaction rates, leading to uncontrolled growth. At temperatures outside the ALD window, the precursor molecules may decompose or desorb the heated substrate, resulting in uncontrolled growth [64]. The"

In thermal ALD, the surface reactions typically happen due to a relatively high temperature. The self- limiting nature of ALD allows for saturation to occur on the surface of the substrate during the dosage steps before the extra unreacted materials are purged out of the reactor. That is, after the chemisorbed species saturate all the available active sites, no more chemisorption would happen beyond that point, although more reactants exist in the reactor [66]. However, the exact mechanisms of ALD reactions remain sophisticated and challenging subjects. Nevertheless, some studies have modeled and predicted ALD reaction mechanisms. The ALD mechanisms are divided into three categories (initial surface reactions, reaction pathways, and precursor decomposition), each of which is briefly discussed below."

Lastly, by- products and unreacted water molecules are pumped out of the reactor [62]. The surface is now hydroxylated again, and the steps are repeated. Another example of ligand- exchange ALD reactions is the deposition of metal oxides using alkoxide precursors [74]. ALD of metals such as copper, ruthenium, and platinum often occurs based on dissociation chemisorption [72,75]. The association mechanism is the hardest to identify since it usually happens after a gas- phase dissociation or before a ligand- exchange reaction. A common example is ALD from metal halide precursors [72]."

DFT is used to investigate the electronic structure of many- body systems by reducing a 3N- dimensional problem to N 3- dimensional problems. In DFT, the structure of molecules may be predicted via the calculation of total energies and forces [75]. There are several examples where DFT has been broadly used along with ALD. DFT can be used to perform precursor design and comparison, predict ALD deposition characteristics such as overall growth, predict activation barriers and transition states, and determine reaction mechanisms such as initial surface reactions, reaction pathways, and the precursor chemisorption process [48,76- 80]."

LBM is categorized as being on the mesoscopic modeling scale, which is appropriate for less complex systems as it needs less memory and has a short processing time [86]. This method employs the Boltzmann equation to model a fluid consisting of fictitious particles that are propagating and colliding [87]. LBM can be used along with ALD to simulate the flow of gases [86]."

Monte Carlo can be used to solve intractable analytical problems or substitute for time- consuming or expensive experiments. Furthermore, researchers can employ this simulation technique to explore different aspects or modify the conditions of an experiment [88]. Random- based has a broad range of applications in finance, engineering, and science [89- 92]. Monte Carlo simulation has been extensively used along with ALD for different purposes, e.g., determining film and precursor properties and the evolution of film morphology, modeling film growth, and studying the kinetics of reactions and the mechanism of materials processing in ALD [93- 97]. Moreover, Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation, which accounts for changes in the process with time, is invaluable in bridging the gap between individual reaction data from DFT and average growth characteristics from experiments [97]."

In the GCM, the thermodynamic properties of a compound are predicted from its molecular structure. For this purpose, the molecule is split up into structural and functional groups composed of individual atoms or small groups of atoms. The GCM parameter of a functional group is estimated by the number of times a particular group appears on the adsorbent, multiplied by its contribution [99]. The GCM can be employed to estimate the thermodynamic properties of precursors used in ALD. For instance, ALD precursor molecules can be divided into smaller groups of atoms, and the GCM estimates the binary interaction parameters between those groups. Then, the activity coefficients of each group can be calculated based on those interaction parameters. Our group recently reported the thermodynamic properties of some well- known precursor molecules, which will be discussed in detail later [100,101]."

In this section, the previous research studies on theoretical ALD are reviewed. Table 2 summarizes the theoretical- study- only ALD articles found in the Web of Science and covered in this review. It is worth mentioning that this review mostly focuses on the theoretical- study- only ALD articles and does not cover the combined experimental and theoretical ones, which are cited here [75,76,130- 156]. Figure 5 displays the publications, summarized in Table 2, that are covered in this study. Figure 5a illustrates the time evolution of publications on ALD studied with at least one of the theoretical methods mentioned above. In this figure, the theoretical- study- only articles are separated from the total set of articles, i.e., those that combine theory and experiments. During the last six years, researchers have focused more on combining experimental ALD studies with theory rather than performing a purely theoretical study. The reason most likely lies within the greater desire to validate experimental data with a computational model to establish their ALD method better. Figure 5b categorizes the publications based on the regions those studies were performed in."

First, they developed a GCM model to predict the thermodynamic properties (i.e., activity coefficients) of the functional groups of already- existing ALD precursor materials such as tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium (TDMAT), tetrakis (diethylamino) titanium (TDEAT), tetrakis (diethylamino) hafnium (TDEAH), and tetrakis (ethylmethylamino) hafnium (TEMAH). Then, using the estimated activity coefficients of those groups, they formulated a CAMD framework to optimally design novel precursor materials for ALD.

In 2003, Puurunen [66] derived a mathematical model based on mass balance to describe ALD growth rate as a function of growth chemistry. The chemistry of growth was defined as the size of the reactants and their chemisorption mechanism on the substrate. Using that model, if the size of the ligands is known, one can simulate the growth per cycle from any compound with a certain chemisorption mechanism. The chemisorption processes of ligand exchange, association, and dissociation were theoretically described for the adsorption of the precursor on the substrate. It was found that either a steric hindrance or a limited number of active sites on the substrate causes surface saturation. According to the author, the steric hindrance of ligands would lead to the growth rate being less than a monolayer per cycle [66]. In another article, the same model was applied to three ALD systems, i.e., "

At higher cycles, a thicker film was observed at the pore edge compared with the pore center, which was attributed to increasing the resistance to precursor diffusion at the pore mouth and the precursor depletion in the central regions with increasing the cycle numbers [96].

According to the authors, the temperature dependency of film growth was in agreement with experimental data, while the growth rate per cycle was overestimated with simulation. Based on their report, the film growth in the reported system was low at lower temperatures, which was attributed to the high activation energy required to eliminate ethyl ligands of the precursor, which in turn caused impurities in the film. However, those barriers would be overcome at higher temperatures, resulting in a higher growth rate [97]."

One interesting observation of that work was that the growth rate was dependent on the location of the sample in their ALD reactor, and the samples near the inlet of the reactor had a higher growth rate than those near the outlet [149]. Although their results showed good agreement between experiments and simulations, they only considered one full ALD cycle in their numerical study. A previous study suggested that after a specific number of ALD cycles where a rather thick film is formed, the growth mechanism and the growth rate may change since the effect of the substrate is diminished [6]. Pan et al. [86] compared two common LBM models to characterize the carrier gas flow in ALD: the lattice Bhatnagar- Gross- Krook (LBGK) and two- relaxation- time (TRT) models. According to their results, the TRT model was more reliable regarding stability, while the LBGK model was better in terms of computational efficiency [86]."

In a previous study, amorphous films deposited by ALD were examined with Monte Carlo simulation [94]. Based on the results, steric hindrance would delay the linear growth [94]. In addition, 3D Monte Carlo simulation has been used to determine the film thickness and sticking coefficients of TMA and bis- diethyl aminosilane (BDEAS) precursors in high- aspect- ratio 3D substrates [93]. In another work, Cremers et al. [179] reported the results of 3D Monte Carlo simulation in ALD on different large geometries, i.e., pillars versus holes. According to the authors, much less precursor exposure is needed for conformal ALD on pillars than holes, which, as a result, makes arrays of pillars more appropriate for ALD [179]."

This elevated growth rate had been observed experimentally and was attributed to the released water molecules from PMMA pores [6]. With the help of the theoretical methods, the precise amount of water vapor from PMMA was calculated and confirmed the previously reported hypothesis. The predicted growth rate on the silicon reference was in agreement with the experimental data. The model also showed that the moles of water molecules acting as the second co- reactant of ALD decreased with increasing the number of ALD cycles [101]. This decreasing trend had been observed with experiments as well [6]."

Based on calculated activation energies, multiple proton diffusions from the surface to amide ligands and rotation of the protonated amine are more energetically favorable than ligand elimination in the initial stage. Thus, multiple proton diffusions to the amide ligands happen before the protonated amine ligands desorb. When the precursor was adsorbed on the surface, multiple protons diffused to amine ligands. That freed up hafnium to bond with oxygen, which had already been freed due to protonation and desorption of ligands and become five- coordinated. Then, hafnium became four- coordinated upon further ligand elimination. Hafnium became more highly coordinated as more ligands were eliminated, forming bonds with more oxygens and causing densification. The remaining ligands exchanged with hydroxyl groups during the water pulse, preparing the surface for the next precursor pulse [79]."

The fundamental and ab initio (first- principles) techniques such as DFT are used to predict atomic behavior at the micro- level. These methods provide detailed information on atomic interactions without depending on experiments since they do not require initial data to be obtained. However, they are time- consuming and can become very expensive. On the contrary, macro- level methods such as CAMD are much faster and more cost- efficient than the aforementioned ones. These methods predict the optimal chemical molecules based on information about building blocks (functional groups) rather than atoms and can be used for reverse engineering. However, the main drawback of these techniques is the necessity of experimental data. For instance, one would need the properties of groups of molecules to use CAMD, requiring experimental data. Thus, whenever there is a lack of experimental data, the ab initio methods are useful, but if the experimental data are available, it would be more efficient to use reverse engineering methods."

However, the temperature is not the only factor affecting ALD reactions. Other factors, such as the substrate, gas flow, reactor design, and adsorbate- adsorbate and adsorbate- adsorbent interactions, affect the predicted mechanisms happening in ALD reactions. Those factors may be varied through computational methods to better predict the behavior of different ALD processes. In addition, most of the theoretical research articles on ALD so far have focused on the processes on inorganic substrates. However, since more and more experimental ALD studies are being performed on organic substrates, such as polymers and biomaterials, the actual growth behavior and reaction mechanisms on these materials are largely unknown. Due to the nature of organic materials, it would be highly complicated and challenging to predict the growth behavior, thin film characteristics, and reaction mechanisms on those substrates. We hope to see such interesting studies from theoreticians in the future to better assist in the design of experiments in those fields."
