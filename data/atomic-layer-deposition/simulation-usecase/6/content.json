        "text": "Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor- phase deposition technique that has attracted increasing attention from both experimentalists and theoreticians in the last few decades. ALD is well- known to produce conformal, uniform, and pinhole- free thin films across the surface of substrates. Due to these advantages, ALD has found many engineering and biomedical applications. However, drawbacks of ALD should be considered. For example, the reaction mechanisms cannot be thoroughly understood through experiments. Moreover, ALD conditions such as materials, pulse and purge durations, and temperature should be optimized for every experiment. It is practically impossible to perform many experiments to find materials and deposition conditions that achieve a thin film with desired applications. Additionally, only existing materials can be tested experimentally, which are often expensive and hazardous, and their use should be minimized. To overcome ALD limitations, theoretical methods are beneficial and essential complements to experimental data. Recently, theoretical approaches have been reported to model, predict, and optimize different ALD aspects, such as materials, mechanisms, and deposition characteristics. Those methods can be validated using a different theoretical approach or a few knowledge- based experiments. This review focuses on recent computational advances in thermal ALD and discusses how theoretical methods can make experiments more efficient.",

ALD originated from two different methods: atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and molecular layering (ML), which were first introduced in the 1970s [2]. ALD then emerged due to the need for precise film thickness on small devices with high aspect ratios [2- 4]. The thin films produced by ALD are deposited using chemical gas or vapor phase species, called precursors, in a cyclic fashion [5]. Thus, ALD is often called an advanced form of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). However, unlike CVD, ALD consists of alternative pulses and purges of the precursors, resulting in deposition of the desired film with an expected thickness and composition [5,6]. Furthermore, ALD is often performed under vacuum and at various ranges of temperatures, from room temperatures up to high temperatures, due to which ALD has a wide temperature window [4].",

During the first half- cycle, the precursor is carried by inert gas and pulsed into the reactor with a determined duration, reacts with the available active sites of the substrate, and is chemisorbed on the surface [5]. In this step, ideally, the precursor saturates the surface through a self- limiting reaction. Then, excess unreacted precursor molecules are purged out of the chamber using inert gas. In the second half- cycle, the co- reactant pulses into the reactor to react with the adsorbed precursor molecules on the substrate [7,8]. The common coreactants for ALD are water vapor,  $\\mathrm{O}_2$ ,  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , and  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  [9]. Finally, the excess co- reactant molecules and the by- products of the reaction are purged out of the reactor.

Here, we present an overview of the common theoretical methods used to model ALD and the insight that can be obtained about the process of ALD from the different types of modeling. Thus, we adopt a reverse engineering approach, where we define various aspects of ALD, describe the experimental procedure used for ALD process development, and describe how modeling and simulation have been used for a proper understanding and improvement of the ALD process. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Thus, the growth rate is often reported for each system under study. In addition, the growth rate is affected by the reactor temperature and pressure, pulse and purge times of the reactants, and the nature of the substrate. The growth rate is often reported as a constant value (the slope of the plot showing film thickness versus the number of cycles); however, some studies reported that the growth rate might change over the number of cycles. For instance, a recent study reported duo- linear plots of  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  film thickness versus the number of ALD cycles.

The ALD growth modes are mainly attributed to one of the following modes: Volmer- Weber growth, Frank- van der Merwe growth, and Stranski- Krastanov growth [57,58]. In the Volmer- Weber growth mode, also known as island growth, small clusters or islands are first nucleated on the surface. The reason for island nucleation, in this case, is that the interaction of the adsorbed atoms within themselves is stronger compared with the interaction between the atoms and the substrate. That is, the cohesive force within the atoms is stronger than the surface adhesive force, so the atoms tend to accumulate. Then, those small clusters grow into larger three- dimensional ones and reach each other, covering the whole surface [57].",

The surface roughness is significantly affected by the growth mode discussed earlier. For instance, the Volmer- Weber growth mode starts with island nucleation; the islands enlarge over time, and, most likely, their heights become larger than the thickness of one monolayer before they converge. Thus, if the growth follows the Volmer- Weber growth mode, the film is often made of rough layers.

During the first half- cycle of the reaction, TMA molecules chemisorb on a hydroxylated surface and react with the OH groups, where a ligand exchange occurs, and methane gas is released. After the surface is thoroughly saturated with the TMA molecules, all unreacted precursors and the by- products of the reactions are purged out. Water molecules enter the reactor in the second half- reaction and react with the  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$ - terminated surface sites. Again, the ligand exchange happens between the  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$  groups of chemisorbed TMA molecules, and OH groups of water vapor and methane gas are released until all the active sites are filled. Lastly, by- products and unreacted water molecules are pumped out of the reactor [62]. The surface is now hydroxylated again, and the steps are repeated. Another example of ligand- exchange ALD reactions is the deposition of metal oxides using alkoxide precursors [74]. ALD of metals such as copper, ruthenium, and platinum often occurs based on dissociation chemisorption [72,75]. The association mechanism is the hardest to identify since it usually happens after a gas- phase dissociation or before a ligand- exchange reaction.

In 2003, Puurunen [66] derived a mathematical model based on mass balance to describe ALD growth rate as a function of growth chemistry. The chemistry of growth was defined as the size of the reactants and their chemisorption mechanism on the substrate. Using that model, if the size of the ligands is known, one can simulate the growth per cycle from any compound with a certain chemisorption mechanism. The chemisorption processes of ligand exchange, association, and dissociation were theoretically described for the adsorption of the precursor on the substrate. It was found that either a steric hindrance or a limited number of active sites on the substrate causes surface saturation. According to the author, the steric hindrance of ligands would lead to the growth rate being less than a monolayer per cycle [66]. In another article, the same model was applied to three ALD systems, i.e.,  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  from TMA and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ , Yttrium oxide  $(\\mathrm{Y}_2\\mathrm{Cl}_3)$  from  $\\mathrm{Y(thd)_3}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  (thd = 2,2,6,6- tetramethyl- 3,5- heptanedionate), and  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  from  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ .

The well- known TMA and water system was employed for that study.

Based on the results of that study, the correlation parameters depended on the precursor chemisorption and steric hindrance [73]. The temperature dependency of the growth rate was also discussed in Puurunen's study, where the temperature effect was related to the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the surface. As the substrate temperature increased, the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups decreased, which in turn reduced the growth rate [73]. The finding was in agreement with the previously discussed study by Elliot [78]. Both of those studies considered  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALD using TMA and water, while, recently, Seo et al. [163] employed DFT to study the effect of different oxidizers (i.e.,  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ ) reacting with TMA.

In that study, uniform film growth was observed up to 75 cycles, beyond which the film grew non- uniformly. At higher cycles, a thicker film was observed at the pore edge compared with the pore center, which was attributed to increasing the resistance to precursor diffusion at the pore mouth and the precursor depletion in the central regions with increasing the cycle numbers [96].

According to the authors, the temperature dependency of film growth was in agreement with experimental data, while the growth rate per cycle was overestimated with simulation. Based on their report, the film growth in the reported system was low at lower temperatures, which was attributed to the high activation energy required to eliminate ethyl ligands of the precursor, which in turn caused impurities in the film.

Although their results showed good agreement between experiments and simulations, they only considered one full ALD cycle in their numerical study. A previous study suggested that after a specific number of ALD cycles where a rather thick film is formed, the growth mechanism and the growth rate may change since the effect of the substrate is diminished [6]. Pan et al. [86] compared two common LBM models to characterize the carrier gas flow in ALD: the lattice Bhatnagar- Gross- Krook (LBGK) and two- relaxation- time (TRT) models.

They reported a detailed mechanism for that ALD system from tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium and water. Based on calculated activation energies, multiple proton diffusions from the surface to amide ligands and rotation of the protonated amine are more energetically favorable than ligand elimination in the initial stage. Thus, multiple proton diffusions to the amide ligands happen before the protonated amine ligands desorb. When the precursor was adsorbed on the surface, multiple protons diffused to amine ligands. That freed up hafnium to bond with oxygen, which had already been freed due to protonation and desorption of ligands and become five- coordinated. Then, hafnium became four- coordinated upon further ligand elimination. Hafnium became more highly coordinated as more ligands were eliminated, forming bonds with more oxygens and causing densification.

However, they are time- consuming and can become very expensive. On the contrary, macro- level methods such as CAMD are much faster and more cost- efficient than the aforementioned ones. These methods predict the optimal chemical molecules based on information about building blocks (functional groups) rather than atoms and can be used for reverse engineering. However, the main drawback of these techniques is the necessity of experimental data. For instance, one would need the properties of groups of molecules to use CAMD, requiring experimental data.
