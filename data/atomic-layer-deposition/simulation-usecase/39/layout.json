However, only few theoretical studies have been reported in the literature. The surface reaction mechanisms and energetics previously reported focus on a gibbsite- like surface model but a more realistic description of the surface can be achieved when the hydroxylation of the surface is taken into account using dissociatively adsorbed water molecules. The adsorbed water changes the structure of the surface and reaction energetics change considerably when compared to previously studied surface model. Here we have studied the TMA- "

Mechanisms and energetics during both the TMA and the subsequent water pulse are presented. TMA is found to adsorb exothermically onto the surface. The reaction barriers for the ligand- exchange reactions between the TMA and the surface hydroxyl groups were found to be much lower compared to previously presented results. TMA dissociation on the surface is predicted to saturate at monomethylaluminium. Barriers for proton diffusion between surface sites are observed to be low. TMA adsorption was also found to be cooperative with the formation of methyl bridges between the adsorbants. The water pulse was studied using single water molecules reacting with the DMA and MMA surface species. Barriers for these reactions were found to reasonable in the process conditions. However, stabilizing interactions amongst water molecules were found to lower the reaction barriers and the dynamical nature of water is predicted to be of importance. It is expected that these calculations can only set an upper limit for the barriers during the water pulse."

The initial gases of the path was created by interpolating the configurations between the initial and final geometries.

The aluminium is \"shielded\" by the surrounding oxygens and it was found that the closed structure made it impossible for a single water molecule to remove the methyl- ligand from the MMA. A short ab initio molecular dynamics simulation with several water molecules suggested that a water molecule might first break the MMA structure from three oxygen coordinated to a two coordinated one. This structure could then react with another water molecule. We have here studied the mechanism (2c) with several water molecules and labelled them as "

Using a gibbsite- like surface model, they found that a DMA on the surface is relatively inert. However, the methyl groups dissociates with relatively low barrier if an additional DMA is introduced close to the reacting hydroxyl group. When the hydroxyl groups oxygens coordination is increased, the proton becomes more acidic resulting in a lower barrier. This effect is less clear on the hydroxylated surface. In our calculations we did not find the same effect, as the reaction barriers were raised due to steric interactions when adsorbants were brought to close proximity (see Section 3.2.2)."

The hydroxylated surface has hydroxyl groups in two different planes while the gibbsite- surface is entirely planar. The adsorbed TMA is less hindered by the neighbouring hydroxyl groups and can more easily reach the transition state on hydroxylated surface. On the gibbsite- like surface the planar structure leads to interactions with the neighbouring hydroxyl groups and makes the TMA more rigid. However, the resulting DMA is twice coordinated to oxygen on the gibbsite- like surface leading to a larger reaction energy."
