The diagram illustrates a network involving atoms and molecules, specifically highlighting the connectivity between oxygen (O), hydrogen fluoride (HfX), hydroxyl group (OH), and water (H2O). The nodes labeled 'empty(1)' and 'HfX(2)' have a connectivity number (c.n) of 2, while 'HfX(0)' has a c.n of 5.
