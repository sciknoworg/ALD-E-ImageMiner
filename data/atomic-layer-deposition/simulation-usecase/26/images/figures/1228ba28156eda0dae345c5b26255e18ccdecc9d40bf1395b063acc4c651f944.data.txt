| A      | A dense molecular structure with a regular pattern of atoms. The structure appears to be layered, with a repeating unit that includes both large and small spheres representing different types of atoms. |
| B      | A less dense molecular structure compared to section A. It also shows a layered pattern but with fewer layers visible. The structure includes similar types of atoms as seen in section A. |
