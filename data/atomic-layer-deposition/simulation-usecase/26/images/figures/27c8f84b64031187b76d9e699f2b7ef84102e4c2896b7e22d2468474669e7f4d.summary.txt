The chart illustrates a hierarchical structure of surface and bulk states in a material, with elements such as Hf, O, and OH at different coordination numbers (c.n). The surface layer includes HfXâ‚‚<sup>(0)</sup> with a coordination number of 5, while the bulk layer shows Hf<sup>(2)</sup>, Hf<sup>(2)</sup>, and Hf<sup>(4)</sup> with coordination numbers of 7, and O atoms with coordination numbers of 3.
