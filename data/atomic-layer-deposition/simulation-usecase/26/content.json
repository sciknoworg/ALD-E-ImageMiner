In this model, all atomistic reaction pathways in density functional theory (DFT) are implemented as reaction events on the lattice. This contains all steps, from the early stage of adsorption of each ALD precursor, kinetics of the surface protons, interaction between the remaining precursors (steric effect), influence of remaining fragments on adsorption sites (blocking), densification of each ALD precursor, migration of each ALD precursors, and cooperation between the remaining precursors to adsorb  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  (cooperative effect). The essential chemistry of the ALD reactions depends on the local environment at the surface. The coordination number and a neighbor list are used to implement the dependencies. The validity and necessity of the proposed reac tion pathways are statistically established at the mesoscale. The formation of one monolayer of precursor fragments is shown at the end of the metal pulse. Adsorption and dissociation of the  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  precursor onto that layer is described, leading to the delivery of oxygen and protons to the surface during the  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  pulse. Through these processes, the remaining precursor fragments desorb from the surface, leaving the surface with bulk- like and OH- terminated  $\\mathsf{HfO_2}$ , ready for the next cycle. The migration of the low coordinated remaining precursor fragments is also proposed. This process introduces a slow reordering motion (crawling) at the mesoscale, leading to the smooth and conformal thin film that is characteristic of ALD. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

For their use in microelectronics, thin films must exhibit a high level of conformality, uniform stoichiometry, and controlled thickness. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an emerging low- temperature deposition technique providing relatively accurate control of composition and good conformality over high- aspect- ratio structures.[1,2] The films are capable of being used in nonplanar structures such as three- dimensional (3D) transistors. Use of thin film materials in the food packaging and pharmaceutical industry allow considerable savings in raw materials.[3] In addition, they can improve the humidity tolerance and performance of polymers.

Inert gas is admitted between each pulse to purge the remaining precursor from the reactor and avoid gas- phase reactions. Because of this, the precursors react with the substrate only. In the ideal case, ALD surface reactions are self- limiting, meaning that reactions cease after the formation of one monolayer of precursor fragments at the end of the pulse. Growth of the product film, therefore, takes place at the level of a submonolayer in each cycle, conformally coating all exposed surfaces if the dose in each pulse is sufficient.",

Different ALD precursors and processing conditions are observed experimentally to give different film properties[4] (e.g., morphology, conformality, thickness) and our assumption is that this is largely due to differences in the reaction pathways at the atomic scale accumulating over thousands of reaction events. A realistic ALD growth mechanism is extremely intricate and may consist of standard ALD acid/base reactions, structural relaxation, CVD- like reactions, and of influential factors such as steric hindrance, coreagent population, and the cooperative effects that we introduce in this article. The dependence of these mechanisms on temperature, the partial pressure of the precursor, pulse and purge times determines the measured process parameters such as ALD growth rate and film properties.",

This technique has been used to model the growth of  $A1_{2}O_{3}$  from  $\\mathsf{Al(CH_3)_3}$  and  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$ .[10] Experimental results[11] show that ALD using this system is possible at low temperatures and, therefore, a relatively low activation energy for the gaseous by- product methane is expected. Hence, applying the interatomic potential for the amorphous alumina surface seems to be a well- suited approach to describing the structural relaxation during ALD growth. However, using MD simulation is unsuitable for ALD systems whose primary reactions fall into the category of the rare event.[12] Also, experimentally measured O/Al ratios vary between 1.34 and 1.70 depending on growth temperature.[11] In this situation, due to the process of densification, which is a driving force for the ALD reactions,[6] the Al atoms should exist at higher coordination number (c.n.) (i.e., c.n. = 5 or 6) than the calculated value (c.n. = 3 or 4). Therefore, a denser film than that actually obtained would be expected and the interatomic potential does not adequately describe the structural relaxation taking place during ALD growth.",

KMC is ideally suited for modeling reaction events in surface science, involving adsorption, desorption, cooperative reaction, and structural relaxation at the surface of the growing film.[14,15] The method can reach simulation times of orders of magnitude longer than ab initio MD, while preserving a level of atomic detail. KMC can accommodate events at different time scales, including rare events. There are many KMC approaches, from coarse- grained model systems with hypothetical input values, to realistic atomic simulation with accurate chemical kinetics for the making and breaking of bonds.

Along these lines a ground- breaking KMC model for ALD was proposed by Dkhissi et al.[17] that considered the ALD reactions and activation energies from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

This can in principle be overcome by using more accurate methods[18,19] rather than DFT. However, owing to the complicated reaction pathways that result from cooperative effects, computing large cells with many atoms (e.g., 500 atoms) is necessary, which is too computationally demanding for the more accurate methods. Hence, at the present time, we rely on the activation energies calculated using DFT.

In TST, the rate constant for the transition from a minimum A to a minimum B is estimated from the equilibrium flux crossing a dividing surface separating the two minima. The dividing surface is the hyperplane perpendicular to the reaction coordinate and the transition state (TS) is where the two intersect. Here, there are two assumptions. First, it is supposed that the system has reached thermal equilibrium between A and TS. Second, it is assumed that successful transitions through the dividing surface from A to B are uncorrelated, meaning that each forward transition through the dividing surface moves the system from A to B. For these assumptions to be valid, the best choice of dividing surface is near the saddle point in the minimum energy path between A and B, where the entire equilibrium flux is minimized. If thermal motion around the saddle point and the minima can be described by second- order expansions (harmonic vibrational modes) then the transition between the two minima can be explained by harmonic TST (hTST).

As a result, further desorption of the remaining ligands is facilitated. However, if the incoming oxygen atoms are poorly coordinated, then they become the active sites for the next Hf pulse.",

The  $\\mathsf{HfX}_3$  fragment in Figure 11C- a at the end of the purge loses HX until it terminates as HfX in Figure 11D- a at the end of the oxygen pulse. As there is no HfX at the neighboring sites, in the case of Figure 11D- a as well as 4f, the metal precursor terminates in HfX at the end of the cycle. This is significantly different from the simple/common assumption that all ligands are eliminated in every ALD cycle. The case illustrated in Figure 11C- e is slightly different. Desorption of HX results in densification of the metal precursor to a pre- existing HfX neighbor. One of the Hf atoms obtains sufficient c.n. from the densified oxygen by dissociation of the  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  molecule at this site. Further desorption of HX occurs from this cluster and fully coordinated Hf does not cooperate to adsorb a further  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  molecule. Hence, another HfX present in the cluster remains under- coordinated in Figure 11D- e.",

These clusters are active sites for adsorption of  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  molecules such as those shown in Figure 11C- c. In this way, almost all ligands are eventually eliminated over many cycles.

We implement all reactions that had been observed in first principles calculations[6] as discrete events in the on- lattice KMC simulation. The fundamental chemistry of ALD and its dependence on the local environment at the surface are implemented using c.n. and neighbor list. This includes all steps, from the early stage of adsorption of each ALD precursor, kinetics of the surface protons, interaction between the remaining precursors (steric effect), influence of remaining fragments on adsorption sites (blocking), densification of each ALD precursor, migration of each ALD precursor, and cooperation between the remaining precursors to adsorb  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  (cooperative effect).
