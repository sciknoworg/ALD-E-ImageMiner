For their use in microelectronics, thin films must exhibit a high level of conformality, uniform stoichiometry, and controlled thickness. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an emerging low- temperature deposition technique providing relatively accurate control of composition and good conformality over high- aspect- ratio structures.[1,2] The films are capable of being used in nonplanar structures such as three- dimensional (3D) transistors. Use of thin film materials in the food packaging and pharmaceutical industry allow considerable savings in raw materials.[3] In addition, they can improve the humidity tolerance and performance of polymers. Developing new ALD processes require better understanding of how film growth depends on the chemicals being used."

Inert gas is admitted between each pulse to purge the remaining precursor from the reactor and avoid gas- phase reactions. Because of this, the precursors react with the substrate only. In the ideal case, ALD surface reactions are self- limiting, meaning that reactions cease after the formation of one monolayer of precursor fragments at the end of the pulse. Growth of the product film, therefore, takes place at the level of a submonolayer in each cycle, conformally coating all exposed surfaces if the dose in each pulse is sufficient."

Different ALD precursors and processing conditions are observed experimentally to give different film properties[4] (e.g., morphology, conformality, thickness) and our assumption is that this is largely due to differences in the reaction pathways at the atomic scale accumulating over thousands of reaction events. A realistic ALD growth mechanism is extremely intricate and may consist of standard ALD acid/base reactions, structural relaxation, CVD- like reactions, and of influential factors such as steric hindrance, coreagent population, and the cooperative effects that we introduce in this article. The dependence of these mechanisms on temperature, the partial pressure of the precursor, pulse and purge times determines the measured process parameters such as ALD growth rate and film properties."

Hence, applying the interatomic potential for the amorphous alumina surface seems to be a well- suited approach to describing the structural relaxation during ALD growth. However, using MD simulation is unsuitable for ALD systems whose primary reactions fall into the category of the rare event.[12] Also, experimentally measured O/Al ratios vary between 1.34 and 1.70 depending on growth temperature.[11] In this situation, due to the process of densification, which is a driving force for the ALD reactions,[6] the Al atoms should exist at higher coordination number (c.n.) (i.e., c.n. = 5 or 6) than the calculated value (c.n. = 3 or 4). Therefore, a denser film than that actually obtained would be expected and the interatomic potential does not adequately describe the structural relaxation taking place during ALD growth."

KMC is used in a wide range of areas from chemistry to biology. In KMC modeling, the true dynamical information (atomic positions and momenta) is dismissed and the atomic trajectories are replaced by a set of discrete positions, chosen from a set of predetermined possible atomic sites. KMC is ideally suited for modeling reaction events in surface science, involving adsorption, desorption, cooperative reaction, and structural relaxation at the surface of the growing film.[14,15] The method can reach simulation times of orders of magnitude longer than ab initio MD, while preserving a level of atomic detail. KMC can accommodate events at different time scales, including rare events. There are many KMC approaches, from coarse- grained model systems with hypothetical input values, to realistic atomic simulation with accurate chemical kinetics for the making and breaking of bonds. In the latter, a proper evaluation of surface kinetics at the mesoscopic scale is possible by using accurate information from first principles the electronic- structure calculations."

The chemistry presented here has been obtained by ab initio calculations using DFT.[6] There is a systematic error due to the approximate DFT exchange- correlation functional that often results in underestimated activation energies for breaking and making bonds. This can in principle be overcome by using more accurate methods[18,19] rather than DFT. However, owing to the complicated reaction pathways that result from cooperative effects, computing large cells with many atoms (e.g., 500 atoms) is necessary, which is too computationally demanding for the more accurate methods. Hence, at the present time, we rely on the activation energies calculated using DFT. If ab activation energies are underestimated, then the time taken to saturation during ALD will be too short, but the sequence of reactions will be correct."

Hence, to implement the surface chemistry discussed earlier, a lattice- based KMC is used and the spatial environment is described through the c.n. and a neighbor list. Clearly, a lattice- based KMC does not explain the morphology of the film during ALD (e.g., crystalline vs. amorphous). In this study, we present only on- lattice KMC. However, the morphology of the film as a function of temperature could be studied by off- lattice KMC.[20] This means that the reported ALD reactions and their activation energies could be used for future off- lattice studies."

In TST, the rate constant for the transition from a minimum A to a minimum B is estimated from the equilibrium flux crossing a dividing surface separating the two minima. The dividing surface is the hyperplane perpendicular to the reaction coordinate and the transition state (TS) is where the two intersect. Here, there are two assumptions. First, it is supposed that the system has reached thermal equilibrium between A and TS. Second, it is assumed that successful transitions through the dividing surface from A to B are uncorrelated, meaning that each forward transition through the dividing surface moves the system from A to B. For these assumptions to be valid, the best choice of dividing surface is near the saddle point in the minimum energy path between A and B, where the entire equilibrium flux is minimized. If thermal motion around the saddle point and the minima can be described by second- order expansions (harmonic vibrational modes) then the transition between the two minima can be explained by harmonic TST (hTST). From these assumptions, the rate constant "

Even if the system includes thousands of potential events, typically only a few events are removed and a few events are added (in the order of 1- 10) to the event list after each execution. It is most efficient to preserve the event list and simply modify the executed event and affected events in the vicinity of that site. Therefore, reinitialization of all possible events in each iteration is not required, an enormous computational saving. In fact, updates of the event list have a much higher impact on the computational cost than generating the random numbers. In this respect, the first reaction method and BKL algorithm perform similarly well."

SPPARKS is written in a modular fashion, allowing new functionality to be added in a straightforward manner. All possible events are specified before the simulation begins. The event list consists of all possible events at each site. Rejection KMC is chosen as the KMC solver for choosing an event from the event list. This KMC solver uses the previously defined BKL- algorithm[24] to update the system clock by eq. (10). The solver executes the chosen event and modifies the occupation of sites. The event list is updated by removing events that have become invalid at modified sites and adding new events for these sites to the event list."

This means that proton diffusion between the surface oxygen and the nitrogen and its reverse is much faster than rotation of the protonated ligand. The most likely events which occur are low barrier events. Hence, the KMC simulation advances extremely slowly, especially considering that the sum of probabilities is over a large number of sites, giving a total rate that is enormously large (superbasin) (subsection Time evolution). To overcome this difficulty, we propose that only the presence of a proton on surface oxygen is necessary for protonation and rotation of the ligand. In other words, we remove (filter) proton diffusion from the surface oxygen to the nitrogen and its reverse from the reaction list. Otherwise, the realistic ALD time will be inaccessible to the current KMC simulation. A side- effect of this is that time evolution of the system does not correspond to the realistic ALD time."

In the cases discussed earlier, hafnium with its remaining ligands has a total c.n. of 5 at least. However, densification may also happen when there is a low population of surface oxygen (Fig. 3).

This is unclear whether this is an artifact of our KMC scheme or whether it matches experiment. The protons can undergo proton diffusion reactions within the sublayers but, without access to X, there is no effect on growth. These events are, therefore, wasteful of CPU time. For instance, the CPU time per cycle increases by a factor of 1.5 between the 5th cycle and 40th cycles, almost entirely due to unproductive diffusion of protons in sublayers. Those protons can be observed as OH groups in the dashed box of Figure 13, which shows the end of the metal pulse after 18 cycles. Those OH groups are highly coordinated or blocked. Despite the free space around them, adsorption of the next metal precursor does not take place."
