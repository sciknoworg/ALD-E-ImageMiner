We find that the adsorption energy and the preferred site of adsorption of the metal precursor are strong functions of the water coverage. As water coverage increases, the metal precursor preferentially interacts with multiple surface adsorption sites. During the water pulse the removal of Cl can be facilitated by either a ligand exchange reaction or the dissociation of Cl upon increase in coordination of the Hf atom of the precursor. Our predicted potential energy surface indicates that a more likely mechanism is hydration of the adsorbed Hf complex up to a coordination number of 7, followed by the dissociation of a chloride ion that is stabilized by solvation. Born- Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations of an adsorbed metal precursor in the presence of a multilayer of water shows that Cl dissociation is facile in sufficient water molecules are present to solvate the "

To achieve the desirable characteristics of ALD deposited films, the precursors must possess several key chemical and physical properties. They must be volatile and thermally stable and must either chemisorb on the substrate or react rapidly with the surface groups resulting from the previous pulse in order to reach the saturation stage rapidly and thereby ensure a reasonable deposition rate."

This contribution does not report a comprehensive study of all active pathways subsequent to the reactions of the precursor and water with the growing surface. For example, reactions leading to densification, such as condensation reactions between neighboring hydroxyl groups, are not reported here. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical simulation to consider the effect of different coordination numbers of Hf as well as the effect of various adsorption sites on the reaction energetics of the ALD process. The first phase of this study involves an approach based on a series of static structural optimizations and calculated energies at low water coverage. However, during the water pulse, i.e., in the high water coverage regime, there is a large number of possible configurations that makes a comprehensive investigation of the chemistry during the water pulse from a static point of view extremely complex (and likely incomplete). Therefore, we also carried out first principles molecular dynamics simulations on the Born- Oppenheimer potential energy hypersurface. These simulations showed that under the water pulse conditions, a more efficient mechanism for the removal of chlorine is viable that involves"
