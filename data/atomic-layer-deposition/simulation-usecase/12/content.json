        "text": "Abstract: Hafnium oxide  $(\\mathrm{HfO_2})$  is a leading candidate to replace silicon oxide as the gate dielectric for future generation metal- oxide- semiconductor based nanoelectronic devices. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has recently gained interest because of its suitability for fabrication of conformal films with thicknesses in the nanometer range. This study uses periodic density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the mechanisms of both half- reactions occurring on the growing surface during the ALD of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  using  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  and water as precursors. We find that the adsorption energy and the preferred site of adsorption of the metal precursor are strong functions of the water coverage. As water coverage increases, the metal precursor preferentially interacts with multiple surface adsorption sites. During the water pulse the removal of Cl can be facilitated by either a ligand exchange reaction or the dissociation of Cl upon increase in coordination of the Hf atom of the precursor. Our predicted potential energy surface indicates that a more likely mechanism is hydration of the adsorbed Hf complex up to a coordination number of 7, followed by the dissociation of a chloride ion that is stabilized by solvation. Born- Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations of an adsorbed metal precursor in the presence of a multilayer of water shows that Cl dissociation is facile in sufficient water molecules are present to solvate the  $\\mathrm{Cl^- }$  anions. Hence, solvation plays a crucial role during the water pulse and provides an alternative explanation for why ALD growth rates for this system decrease at high temperatures.",

        "text": "IntroductionMoore's law, which states that the number of electronic devices in integrated circuits increases exponentially over time, has driven the microelectronic industry for the past several decades. However, continued scaling of semiconductor devices requires the integration of novel fabrication processes and new materials into future semiconductor technology. For example, as the thickness of the  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  gate dielectric in silicon metal oxide- semiconductor field effect transistor devices approaches atomic dimensions, the tunneling current through the gate dielectric increases exponentially and serious performance and reliability issues arise. Hence, there is a need for an alternative higher permittivity gate dielectric (high-  $k$ ) to replace  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ . In addition, the deposition process must result in uniform, conformal and pinhole- free thin films of the high-  $k$  dielectric material with atomic level control over large areas.  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  has become a leading candidate to replace  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  due to its relatively high dielectric constant, sufficient band offset from Si, low electrical conductivity, and good thermodynamic stability against silicide formation. Among other possibilities, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been proposed for the deposition of high-  $k$  gate dielectrics, including  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  because of its ability to deposit uniform and conformal thin films. ALD can be viewed as a chemical vapor deposition process based on sequential, self- terminating reactions between the surface and precursors. Because the precursors are introduced into the reactor separately, ALD does not involve gas phase reactions, meaning that it is ideally a completely surface- reaction- limited process. To achieve the desirable characteristics of ALD deposited films, the precursors must possess several key chemical and physical properties. They must be volatile and thermally stable and must either chemisorb on the substrate or react rapidly with the surface groups resulting from the previous pulse in order to reach the saturation stage rapidly and thereby ensure a reasonable deposition rate.",

Thus, most of the previous mechanistic work has addressed the ALD of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  on silicon and silicon oxide substrates.11,12,16- 19 Yet, the number of mechanistic studies investigating the ALD of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  on as- grown  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  is even more scarce. Furthermore, in order to make the simulations tractable, the few theoretical studies that have been done describe the surface using cluster models of limited size which neglect the effect of both the environment relaxation and the electrostatic field of the extended surface. Similarly, the ALD of related transition metal oxides, such as  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  on  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  using their corresponding halides as precursors has also been theoretically studied using either naked cluster models20 or introducing environment effects through a QM/MM approach.21 Moreover, a common aspect of the simulations of metal oxide ALD that use  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  surfaces as a substrate are intended to model the initial substrate conditions that take place in the first few ALD cycles, which most likely differs significantly from the mechanisms on the as- grown oxide.",

The hydroxylated (001)  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  surface consists of different adsorption sites, including bridging oxygen sites and hydroxyl groups. An additional challenge to take into account is the variability of the coordination number of Hf atoms, as it is a transition metal element, and exhibits coordination numbers ranging from 4 to 8.

Under growth conditions both the monoclinic (111) and (001) faces of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  have been observed with the ratio of the two depending on the experimental variables. As stated above, we showed that although the anhydrous (111) surface is more stable, the (001) termination is preferred after surface hydroxylation. Therefore, given that the reaction involves water as an oxygen source, we chose the  $\\mathrm{m - HfO_2}$  (001) face for further modeling. Also, with the aim of modeling the extended nature of the surface we adopted the well- known supercell approach with periodic three- dimensional spanning.

Therefore, because the experimental conditions for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  ALD vary during the process, for example, during transients, it seems reasonable to begin by first considering the possible scenarios that correspond to the different degrees of water coverage.

In the case of adsorption to a single adsorption site the precursor can bind to the surface through either oxygen atoms bound to two Hf atoms (bridge oxygens) or to hydroxyl groups.

Thus, at low water coverages the supercell slab model presents the adsorbing precursor with bridge and dibridge sites, mixed bridge- hydroxyl sites and hydroxyl sites, but with hydroxyls spaced too far apart to allow coordination to two hydroxyls on precursor adsorption. However, on the actual surface at the same water coverage fluctuations in coverage will present some dihydroxyl sites for adsorption. At  $100\\%$  water coverage bridge oxygen atom sites are no longer available so that dibridge and mixed adsorption sites are precluded. However, for lower coverages it is worth noting that like the precursor- bridge oxygen interaction, the adsorption energies on dibridge sites are also a function of coverage. Indeed, on increasing the water coverage from 25 to  $75\\%$  the adsorption energy of  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  on dibridge sites decreases from 35.2 to  $25.6\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$ . This behavior can again be understood by analyzing the effect of water coverage on the interactions between the chlorine atoms of the precursor and the undercoordinated hafnium atoms of the substrate. At both 25 and  $50\\%$  water coverage undercoordinated hafnium atoms still persist, but by  $75\\%$  coverage all surface Hf atoms are fully coordinated, either bound to surface oxygens or to adsorbed water. These interactions are illustrated in Figure 2a and b, which depict the structures of adsorbed  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  on dibridge oxygen sites at coverages of 25 and  $75\\%$  respectively.",

        "text": "In summary, we have performed periodic density functional theory and BOMD simulations to investigate the mechanisms of both half- reactions occurring during the earliest steps of the ALD of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  using  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  and water as precursors. We find that the adsorption energy and the preferred adsorption site for the metal precursor are strong functions of the water coverage. Experimentally, it is found that the growth per cycle decreases when the temperature rises. Increasing the temperature causes dehydroxylation, thereby decreasing the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the surface. There is often some misconception in the literature associated with the role of hydroxyl groups in ALD where water is used as an oxygen source. They are usually considered to be the only anchoring groups for metal precursors. In contrast, our adsorption energies indicate that bridge oxygen atoms present on  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  surface have the largest adsorption energy. Hence, the relationship between the amount of metal precursor anchored to the surface and the hydroxyl group density and consequently the effect of hydroxyl group density on the ALD growth rate does not seem to be straightforward.",

        "text": "As the water coverage increases, the metal precursor preferentially interacts with multiple surface adsorption sites with the distribution of these sites changing as a function of water coverage. During the water pulse the removal of Cl can be facilitated by either a ligand exchange reaction or the dissociation of Cl upon increase in coordination of the Hf of the adsorbed precursor. Our calculated potential energy surface indicates that a more likely mechanism is hydration of the surface Hf complex until the Hf atom reaches a coordination number of 7, followed by the dissociation of a chloride ion. Furthermore, Born- Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations of the adsorbed  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  precursor in the presence of a multilayer of water show that Cl dissociation easily takes place when sufficient water molecules are nearby to solvate the  $\\mathrm{Cl^- }$  anions. Hence, solvation plays a central role during the water precursor pulse.",
