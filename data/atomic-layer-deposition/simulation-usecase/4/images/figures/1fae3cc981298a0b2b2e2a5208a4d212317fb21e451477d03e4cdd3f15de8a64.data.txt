| A | Depicts a surface with a non-growth area and growth area marked. Blue dots represent molecules, and red dots represent atoms. |
| B | Shows the process where red atoms start to form on the growth area, while blue molecules remain unaffected. |
| C | Illustrates the completion of the growth process, with both red atoms and green molecules present on the surface. |
| D | A cross-sectional view of a patterned surface with alternating yellow and gray stripes. |
| E | Indicates the application of area-selective ALD of SiO₂. |
| F | Shows the final state with a patterned surface where green represents the deposited SiO₂ layer. |
