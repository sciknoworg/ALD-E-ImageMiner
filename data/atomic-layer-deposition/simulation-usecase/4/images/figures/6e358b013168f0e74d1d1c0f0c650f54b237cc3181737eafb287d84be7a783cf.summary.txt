The line chart illustrates the apparent thickness (in nm) of three different treatments (A - Hacac, B - BDEAS, C - O₂ plasma) over multiple cycles on two substrates (Al₂O₃ and SiO₂). The treatments show varying trends in thickness, with some treatments showing a consistent pattern while others exhibit more erratic changes.
