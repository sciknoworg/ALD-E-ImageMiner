The line chart illustrates the energy changes (Î”E) in kJ/mol across various states (CS, TS, PS, Product) for two reaction pathways (R1a, R1b, R2a, R2b). The chart shows that the energy decreases significantly from the initial state (CS) to the product states, with the lowest energy observed at PS(R1b) and the highest at TS(R2b).
