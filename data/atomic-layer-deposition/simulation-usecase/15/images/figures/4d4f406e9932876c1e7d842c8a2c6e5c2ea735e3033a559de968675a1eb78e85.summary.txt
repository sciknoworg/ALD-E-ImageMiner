The image depicts a chemical reaction pathway involving zirconium (Zr) and silicon (Si) species. It illustrates various steps (R1a, R1b, R2a, R2b, etc.) where Zr species react with Si species, forming different hydroxylated and chlorinated compounds. The reactions involve the removal of HCl and the addition of water (H2O), leading to the formation of Zr-O-Si bonds.
