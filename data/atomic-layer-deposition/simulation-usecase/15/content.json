Fourteen possible pathways are designed to investigate the detailed chlorine loss reaction mechanism based on the two- dimer trench silicon cluster model. Experiment shows that HCl self- elimination is the dominant reaction pathway at the low temperatures, and that hydrolysis is the dominant pathway at elevated temperatures for the second chlorine loss reaction. However, our calculations show that raising temperature would not result in HCl self- elimination reaction to be unfavorable. Therefore, the decrease of the number of hydroxyls is the possible reason. In addition, for the four chlorines loss, the reactions on the two- dimer cluster across the trench are compared with those on the same dimer cluster from the viewpoint of energy.",

Among various fabrication methods for growing high-  $\\kappa$  thin films, atomic layer deposition (ALD) shows its unique advantages in depositing ultra thin films with highly conformal and uniform growth over large areas. In ALD, each precursor is pulsed onto the substrate surface in the reaction chamber alternately, and the reaction between the incoming precursors and surface species is self- terminating. As a result, atomic level control of film growth can be achieved [2].",

The remaining two chlorine groups on the surface are released during the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  pulse. However, with increasing substrate temperature, the number of chlorine loss decrease gradually during the  $\\mathrm{ZrCl_4}$  pulse.

Thus, we can suggest that R2a and R2b are more energetically favorable than R3a and R3b, i.e. HCl self- elimination reaction is more thermodynamically favorable than HCl- elimination reaction via hydrolysis at elevated temperatures. However, experiments [15] have shown that R3a and R3b rather than R2a and R2b will be the main reaction pathways at elevated temperatures. Theoretical studies [26] have shown the number of surface hydroxyls will affect the chlorine loss at elevated temperatures, because surface hydroxyls will form water with each other, and this trend can be strengthened at elevated temperatures. In order to look for the water loss reaction pathway, the final product of the four chlorine loss reaction is employed as the model. This allows us to simulate the water loss mechanism on the growing  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  films. Calculation shows that the neighboring  $\\mathrm{Zr - OH}$  can easily form the bridged  $\\mathrm{Zr - O - Zr}$  group with an activation energy of  $36.2\\mathrm{kJ / mol}$  (TS is shown in Fig. 7). The replacement of surface hydroxyl by bridged oxygen would result in the decrease of HCl self- elimination reactions R2a and R2b. As a result, HCl- elimination reaction via hydrolysis, i.e., R3a and R3b, will become the dominating chlorine loss pathways at elevated temperatures.",

Fourteen possible pathways for the chlorine loss are proposed according to surface reactions occurring either on the same dimer or on the adjacent dimers across the trench. We find that the precursor  $\\mathrm{ZrCl_4}$  can be adsorbed directly on the hydroxylated silicon surface to form a stable adsorbed complex, and that the by- product HCl prefers to stay at the reactive surface in all the fourteen pathways. These results indicate that the elimination of chlorine contamination is needed in the process of manufacturing  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  thin films. The temperature effects on the second chlorine loss reaction are also studied theoretically based on the experiments. Experiment shows that HCl self- elimination is the dominant reaction pathway at the low temperatures, and hydrolysis is the dominant pathway at elevated temperatures. However, our calculation shows that raising temperature would not lead to HCl self- elimination reaction to be unfavorable. Thus, the decrease of the number of hydroxyls is the possible reason. For the third and fourth chlorine loss, we find that the reactions on the two- dimer trench cluster are energetically more favorable than those on the same dimer cluster at the low temperatures. In addition, we find that the third chlorine loss occurs on the adjacent dimers, and the fourth chlorine loss occurs on the same dimer more easily at elevated temperatures.",
