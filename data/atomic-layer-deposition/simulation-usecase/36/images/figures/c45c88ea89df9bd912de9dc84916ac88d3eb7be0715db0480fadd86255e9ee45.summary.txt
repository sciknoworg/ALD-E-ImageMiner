The image presents a composite of four different types of visualizations: a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) line scan, an atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, and a height profile line plot. These visualizations collectively provide a detailed analysis of the composition and topography of ALD Al₂O₃/patterned ODPA layers.
