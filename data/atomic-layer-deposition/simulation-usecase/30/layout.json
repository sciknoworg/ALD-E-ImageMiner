For trimethylaluminum (TMA), an additional favorable SMI layer decomposition mechanism is found compared to that of the bulkier triethylaluminum (TEA), which could explain the lower selectivity of TMA found experimentally.

In view of the climate crisis, the steadily growing demand poses challenges that can partly be addressed by the downsizing of features toward novel nanowatterned devices to reduce the energy required for manufacturing and use. Despite its transition to ever shorter wavelengths, photolithography technology today represents a bottleneck in terms of manufacturing capacity and feature size reduction down to a few nanometers. Therefore, the development of alternative bottom- up fabrication techniques yielding patterned ultrathin films while qualifying for high- volume manufacturing has sparked greater interest in the scientific community and industry."

To achieve this, the chemical properties of the respective substrate surfaces need to be exploited. The most versatile strategy at the moment uses inhibitor molecules selectively binding to the NGS. Thereby, the NGS is shielded against precursors and co- reactants, which allows for broad implementation in various AS- ALD systems. The first class of inhibitors used belongs to the class of self- assembling monolayers (SAMs) that consist of a reactive head group tuned to selectively bind to the NGS and a large tail group to achieve a dense blocking layer on the NGS. Although SAMs have been shown to ensure high selectivity over many cycles"

Several chemical reactions could be responsible, like interactions of the SMI with a precursor molecule and a co- reactant or thermal decomposition of the SMI layer.

The reason is that the reaction barrier height mainly depends on the formation of the pentavalent TS at the SMI silicon atom, whereas the dispersion interaction with the surface remains nearly constant during the reaction. The other major influence on the TS energy is the energy penalty invoked for the neighboring surface oxygen atoms to come into the proximity. Here the assumption is that the energy penalty to form the TS approximately equals that of the products according to the Hammond postulate."

For a change of perspective, this chapter shows an example, how the conformational freedom of the inhibitor in its bonding configurations can lead to incomplete silanol coverage. Subsequently, a remedy is briefly discussed. Panels a and b of Figure 8 show two DB- O:13 conformers on A.1 that differ in the placement of the remaining methoxy group. In Figure 8a, the methoxy groups points toward O2, where it can form the well- stabilized TBO:123 configuration by another condensation reaction. However, the methoxy group in Figure 8b points away from O2, so that O2 remains unblocked. Adding two additional SMIs in the energetically most favorable way to this structural motif results in A.1- O:13/56/4. Here, DB- O:56 and SB- O:4 were selected, because TB- O:256 cannot be formed and O:24 is hindered by a strong energy penalty. Hence, O2 remains unblocked in this surface model. Furthermore, computational experiments to acquire either a PS or a TS with a fourth TMPS molecule at the remaining Si- OH group at position O2 failed, because O2 is the least accessible "

Moreover, because the reaction proceeds without leaving groups and the TMA fragments stay in the proximity on the surface, the reaction is reversible. Thus, even if the activation barrier could be overcome under ALD conditions to yield the product state, the equilibrium is clearly shifted to the side of the reactants. Hence, although the Al precursors might temporarily exist in the described product form, the thermodynamically expectable outcome is the restoration of the reactant state. Ultimately, because the adsorption at the RBO itself is endothermic, the desorption and purging of the Al precursors are highly likely during the purge phase. Therefore, even if a reaction of an Al precursor with the RBO takes place, it does not affect the selectivity of the process observed after a whole AS- ALD cycle at a sufficiently high blocking layer density. In other words, even if the chemical passivation of the initially present surface groups is not complete by the end of the inhibitor pulse, the thereby achieved SMI blocking layer density might still suffice to prevent side reactions through steric blocking."

In our case, the precursor reaches the surface, but the SMI layer limits further reactivity. Depending on the SMI coverage and ALD precursor, one of the two effects dominates. We thus propose to split up the term \"steric blocking\" in the context of AS- ALD with SMIs into an \"adsorption preventing\" effect (the previously discussed effect) and the new \"reactivity reduction\" effect."

This results in an SMI- oxygen- connected precursor fragment, while ethane (TMA) or propane (TEA) is formed. Because the mechanism yields an SMI layer- bonded aluminum fragment, this could diminish the selectivity of the ALD process. In the second mechanism, the methoxy groups are substituted for the Al precursor ligand (methyl or ethyl), and a di(m)ethylaluminum(m)ethanoxide molecule is formed as the leaving group (Scheme 3D). In contrast to the former reaction pathway, this mechanism could be highly beneficial for the selectivity of the AS- ALD process, because it replaces the reactive methoxy groups with inert alkyl groups and ejects the Al species from the surface."

Hence, as the methoxy groups have been removed, OH groups are present during the following precursor pulse. The gas phase reaction data presented in ref 14 suggest that these OH groups are very reactive to the Al precursors. Thus, the hydroxyl groups will react with the Al precursor molecules during the following precursor pulse, which leads to SMI- bound Al precursor fragments [as in reaction C (Table S5)]. Although this feature is not yet fully understood, we expect a negative impact on selectivity. As a solution to this problem, understanding the role of the precursor fragments and investigating possibilities to replace methoxy groups after the SMI deposition by more inert groups are expected to be valuable future research questions for alkoxysilane SMIs.

Most notably, we show that the SMI layer blocking ability is not solely through the chemical passivation of OH groups and steric blocking of diffusion paths to the surface. Beyond that, the SMI layer influences the reactant, product, and transition state energies by the \"reactivity reduction\" effect of the reactions happening within it. We thus propose to talk about \"adsorption prevention\" and \"reactivity reduction\" as steric blocking effects in AS- ALD with SMIs. The higher the spatial requirements of a transition or product state and the denser the SMI layer density, the higher the resulting energy penalty. Hence, achieving the highest obtainable SMI layer density in combination with spatially demanding precursors and co- reactants is the key to ensuring area selectivity over many cycles in SMI- based AS- ALD experiments."
