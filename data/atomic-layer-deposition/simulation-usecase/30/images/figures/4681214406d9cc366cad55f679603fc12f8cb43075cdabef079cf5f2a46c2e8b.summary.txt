The chart illustrates a chemical reaction pathway involving the removal of methanol (-3 MeOH) and trimethylsilylpropyl (TMPS) groups, followed by the addition of a silylpropyl (SiPr) group and the release of hydrogen ions (+3 H'). It also shows a relaxed model transitioning to a TB residue with an energy change (+Î”E_TB-pen).
