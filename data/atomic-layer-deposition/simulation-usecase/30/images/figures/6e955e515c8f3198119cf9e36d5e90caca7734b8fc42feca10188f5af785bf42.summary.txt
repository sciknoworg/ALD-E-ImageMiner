The chart illustrates different molecular structures with their adsorption energies (Î”E_ads). Structures a) and b) show negative adsorption energies indicating favorable interactions, while structure c) has a negative energy but a significantly larger magnitude, suggesting a stronger interaction. Structure d) shows positive adsorption energies, indicating unfavorable interactions.
