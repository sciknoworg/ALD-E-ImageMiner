| Subfigure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| a) | A molecular structure with atoms represented by spheres and bonds by lines. The atoms are colored differently, possibly indicating different types of atoms. |
| b) | A more complex molecular structure than a), showing additional atoms and bonds. The color coding remains consistent with a). |
| c) | Similar to b), this subfigure shows another molecular structure with a similar level of complexity and color coding. |
| d) | Another molecular structure, similar in complexity to c), with the same color coding. |
