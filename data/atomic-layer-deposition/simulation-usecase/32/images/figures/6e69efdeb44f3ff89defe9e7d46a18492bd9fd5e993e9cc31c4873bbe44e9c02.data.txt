| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| Reactor: | Model constant flow of argon Outlet pressure=50 mTorr |
| | Get pressure distribution Get outlet flow rate Get side inlet pressure |
| | Implement the calculated flow rate as outlet boundary condition |
| | Implement the calculated pulses as inlet boundary condition |
| | Simulate ALD exposure steps |
| Feeding system: | Model argon flow / Feeding system Outlet pressure= Reactor side inlet pressure |
| | Simulate valve opening/ compute reactant pulses |
