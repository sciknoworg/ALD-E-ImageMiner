The image displays two different wireframe models. On the left, there's a complex structure resembling a bottle with a neck and a cylindrical base, possibly representing a mechanical part or a component of a device. On the right, there's a simpler model consisting of a horizontal pipe with vertical supports and two hanging cylindrical objects, which could represent a sensor setup or a similar system.
