The chart illustrates the increase in -OH concentration (in nm^-2) over ALD cycles for two different hydrogen concentrations (H: 6.0% and H: 0.5%). The concentration increases steadily with more ALD cycles for both concentrations, but the rate of increase is higher for the higher hydrogen concentration.
