SiC films are currently deposited using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at high temperatures  $1500 - 1600^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . However, there is a need to deposit SiC- based films on the surface of high aspect ratio features at low temperatures. One of the most precise thin film deposition techniques on high- aspect- ratio surfaces that operates at low temperatures is atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, there are currently no known methods for ALD of SiC. Herein, the authors present a first- principles thermodynamic analysis so as to screen different precursor combinations for SiC thin films. The authors do this by calculating the Gibbs energy  $\\Delta G$  of the reaction using density functional theory and including the effects of pressure and temperature. This theoretical model was validated for existing chemical reactions in CVD of SiC at  $1000^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The precursors disilane  $(\\mathrm{Si}_2\\mathrm{H}_6)$ , silane  $(\\mathrm{SiH}_4)$ , or monochlorosilane  $(\\mathrm{SiH}_3\\mathrm{Cl})$  with ethyne  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_2)$ , carbonetetrachloride  $(\\mathrm{CCl}_4)$ , or trichloromethane  $(\\mathrm{CHCl}_3)$  were predicted to be the most promising for ALD of SiC at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . © 2016 American Vacuum Society.

Nine different carbon precursors [methane  $(\\mathrm{CH}_4)$ , ethane  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_6)$ , ethyne  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_2)$ , ethylene  $(\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_4)$ , propane  $(\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_8)$ , propene  $(\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_6)$ , propadiene  $(\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_4)$ , propyne  $(\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_4)$ , butane  $(\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_{10})$  with silane  $(\\mathrm{SiH}_4)$  were analyzed by Hallin et al. for the CVD growth of 4H and 6H SiC epitaxial layers, in the temperature range of  $1550 - 1600^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The most stable growth at high growth rates was achieved with propane  $(\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_8)$ . For silicon precursors besides silane  $(\\mathrm{SiH}_4)$  the most commonly used are chlorosilanes, such as dichlorosilane  $\\mathrm{SiH}_2\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  (DCS), trichlorosilane  $\\mathrm{SiHCl}_3$  (TCS), methyltrichlorosilane  $\\mathrm{SiCH}_3\\mathrm{Cl}_3$  (MTS), and tetrachlorosilane  $\\mathrm{SiCl}_4$  (TET). TET and TCS are the most common. A review of chloride- based CVD growth of SiC was done by Pedersen et al. Single- source precursors (containing both Si and C in the same molecule) have also been used for CVD of SiC. These precursors include: MTS, methylsilane  $(\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{- SiH}_3)$ , diethylmethylsilane  $[(C_2H_5)_2\\mathrm{SiHCH}_3]$ , tetramethylsilane  $[\\mathrm{Si}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_4]$ , hexamethyldisilane  $[\\mathrm{Si}_2(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_6]$ , silacyclobutane  $[\\mathrm{SiH}_2(\\mathrm{CH}_2)_3]$ , and 1,3- disilabutane  $(\\mathrm{SiH}_2\\mathrm{- CH}_2\\mathrm{- SiH}_2\\mathrm{- CH}_2)$ .",
