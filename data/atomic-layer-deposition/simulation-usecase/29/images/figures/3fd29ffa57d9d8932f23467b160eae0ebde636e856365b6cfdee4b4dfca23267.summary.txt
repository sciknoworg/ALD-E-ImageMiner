The scatter plot illustrates the growth rate (nm/cyc) of TDEAT over different pulse times (s). The data points represent calculated (GR calc), experimentally interpolated (GR exp (interpolated)), and experimental (GR exp) growth rates. The RÂ² value of 0.99 indicates a strong correlation between pulse time and growth rate.
