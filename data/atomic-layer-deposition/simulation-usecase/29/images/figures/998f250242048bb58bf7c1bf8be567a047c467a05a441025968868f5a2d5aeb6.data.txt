| 2 | Starting the EACO algorithm<br>Selecting binary interaction parameters |
| 3 | Computing activity coefficients using UNIFAC GCM based on ASST |
| 4 | Computing total number of moles n<sup>*</sup><sub>T</sub> from modified G<sup>E</sup> model |
| 5 | Computing GR<sub>calc</sub> from the number of moles of Ti in surface n<sup>s</sup><sub>Ti</sub> |
| 6 | Evaluating the difference between calculated and experimental GR values |
