        "text": "Nanomaterials and nanostructures with multi- functional properties found widespread applications such as electronics, optics, and coatings that can be fabricated using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). ALD is a vapor phase deposition technique to generate thin films of metals and metal oxides on a substrate. In this process, a precursor, which often comprises of organic functional groups that surround the depositing metal, chemisorbs on the substrate or reacts with the surface sites and with each other. Precursor chemisorption on the substrate leads ALD to be a self- limiting process. Thus, the precursor(s) should be chosen in a way to enhance deposition based on the ALD conditions. For a given application, it is practically impossible to carry out a large number of experiments using numerous precursors with varied deposition conditions to find the one that maximizes the growth rate in ALD. In addition, only existing precursors can be tested experimentally. The overall objective of this work is to develop a computational tool for the in- silico design of precursor materials using adsorbate solid solution theory (ASST). In the first part of this paper, we apply the ASST to derive properties of the functional groups present in the precursor using a new Group Contribution Method (GCM). The GCM is successfully derived and compared with the experimental data from ALD. The method shows good agreement and is useful for the design of novel materials. In the second part of this paper, using the thermodynamic properties as obtained from GCM, we develop a computer- aided molecular design (CAMD) framework for the optimal design of novel precursor materials with enhanced deposition properties for the ALD of metal oxides and metals. The metaheuristic efficient ant colony optimization algorithm (EACO) developed in- house is used for both parts. CAMD is a combinatorial optimization methodology, where molecules with optimal desired properties are generated from functional groups. The precursor selection optimization problem is posed as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is solved using EACO. The ALD growth kinetics is used as an objective of optimization and a solution is validated with thermodynamic constraints. Along with the number of groups, the temperature is also included in the optimization framework as decision variables. Forty- one novel titanium precursor molecular structures for ALD are generated with growth rates ranging from 1.23 Å/cycle to as high as 1.65 Å/cycle. Thus, these precursors have shown growth rates higher than the known titanium precursors. ALD growth rate is found to be a function of the combination of the precursor functional groups as well as temperature with a complex correlation among them.",

High- temperature dielectric is another area where new material development is actively pursued to increase the temperature- endurance of capacitors used in high- temperature aerospace power electronic systems for the future generation of nanoelectronics (Xu et al., 2012). Many such applications warrant extensive materials search. No proven theory or method yet exists to help us expedite material selection/property prediction during this technology development cycle.

ALD is a vapor phase technique in which the deposition of thin films takes place on a substrate. Sequential and self- limiting surface reactions that happen in the ALD process create conformal and pinhole- free films, which can be precisely controlled over thickness and composition (Bishal et al., 2015; George, 2010). The thin films produced by ALD have extensive applications such as in semiconductors (Kim, 2003), optical coatings, solar cells (M Ritala et al., 1994), ferroelectric material (Chang et al., 2016), high- k transistors, fuel cells (Johnson et al., 2014), and biomedical applications (Bishal et al., 2017, 2018; Shahmohammadi et al., 2020a).

The ALD precursor is usually selected based on few key physical properties, which is thought to produce thin films with the desired property (e.g., adsorption capacity, dielectric constant, leakage current, gas impermeability, electrical conductivity, photochemical activity, and antimicrobial activity) (Huang, 2017; Leskelä and Ritala, 2002; Majumder et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2012). The structure of the precursor and precursor adsorption are essential elements of ALD; hence, the optimal design of novel precursor materials is at the center of this study.

ASST incorporates the influence of the functional groups through the Group Contribution Method (GCM) methodology (Benavides and Diwekar, 2014). In GCM, the thermodynamic properties of a compound are predicted from its molecular structure. The molecule is split up into structural and functional groups that can be composed of individual atoms or small groups of atoms. The GCM parameter of a functional group is estimated by the number of times a particular group appears in the adsorbent (solid substrate in ALD) multiplied by its contribution. The parameterized GCMs are used for the estimation of binary interaction parameters between different groups, where there is no available experimental data and can avoid the need for expensive experimentation for that purpose (Khalifa and Lue, 2017). Estimation of binary interaction parameter for calculation of activity coefficients for separation process like distillation requires the use of the Universal Quasi- chemical Functional- group Activity Coefficient (UNIFAC) model for GCM to predict the vapor- liquid equilibrium (Fredenslund, 2012). In ASST, a modified version of the UNIFAC model is presented that uses the model to compute the activity coefficient in the adsorbate solid solution. ASST has been used effectively for the prediction of adsorption of radioactive elements as well as arsenic in clay- based adsorbents (Benavides et al., 2015; Benavides and Diwekar, 2014; Doshi et al., 2018) and metal ions in polymer resin (Mukherjee et al., 2017). In the present work, an extended version of ASST is used to predict the chemisorption on a silicon substrate in ALD. An optimization framework based on efficient ant colony optimization (EACO) (Diwekar and Gebreslassie, 2016; Gebreslassie and Diwekar, 2015) is used to minimize the difference between predicted and experimental data in order to obtain the optimal value of the interaction parameter.",

CAMD methods have been applied extensively in various areas such as extraction solvents (Cheng and Wang, 2008; Gebreslassie and Diwekar, 2015; Giovanoglou et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004; Marcoulaki and Kokossis, 2000; Samudra and Sahinidis, 2013), polymer designs (Hostrup et al., 1998; Mukherjee et al., 2017), degreasing solvents (Trevizo et al., 2000), blanket wash solvents (Chemmangattuvalappil et al., 2009; Sinha and Achenie, 2001), absorption solvents (Eden et al., 2004; Eljack and Eden, 2008; Odele and Macchietto, 1993; Pistilopoulos and Stefanis, 1998; Salazar et al., 2013), refrigerant design (Churi and Achenie, 1996; Duvedi and Achenie, 1996), distillation solvents (Kim et al., 2004; Kim and Diwekar, 2002; Xu and Diwekar, 2007, 2005), reaction solvents (Folic et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2005), catalysts (Lin et al., 2005), value added products (Camarda and Sunderesan, 2005), crystallization solvent (Karunanithi et al., 2006), and foaming agents (Yamamoto and Tochigi, 2008).

The thermodynamic properties (i.e., binary interaction parameters between precursor functional groups with each other and with the substrate) are estimated with UNIFAC GCM. Then the growth rates were computed using a model equation derived from ASST, which is, in turn, compared to the experimental growth rates. It has been shown that one can predict the growth rate of an ALD system theoretically with this new method, without requiring expensive experiments. In the second part of this work, these estimated properties of the functional groups are used to generate new precursor molecules using CAMD. Gebreslassie and Diwekar (Gebreslassie and Diwekar, 2015) have used EACO algorithm for CAMD of environmentally benign solvents. Comparison of their results with different optimization techniques showed improved solution using EACO that has prompted us to use the same optimization algorithm. It is practically impossible to synthesize numerous precursors and carry out a large number of ALD experiments with varied deposition conditions in order to find the optimum one with improved properties. CAMD framework is used to overcome those issues of design and development of precursor materials without performing expensive and time- consuming experiments. Based on the properties of the functional groups that have already been estimated by GCM, CAMD explores all combinations and generates possible molecules. From the generated ones, improved molecules are selected based on the predicted properties by UNIFAC GCM.

Adsorption can be physical or chemical, also known as physisorption and chemisorption, respectively. In each adsorption process, there are two major phases: the bulk phase and the adsorbed or surface phase. In ALD, the precursor molecules from the bulk phase are chemisorbed on the substrate (Puurunen, 2003b), which is the solid phase, and this continues until the adsorbent reaches its maximum capacity when the system reaches adsorption equilibrium. During equilibrium, the adsorption rate equals the desorption rate, and no more adsorbate can be adsorbed. An isotherm can describe the adsorption equilibrium by plotting the amount of adsorbate adsorbed (q) versus the concentration of adsorbate in the bulk phase (C). In an isotherm where the graph begins to show a plateau is the maximum adsorption capacity. Similarly, in an ALD process, the growth rate forms a plateau as we increase the precursor pulse time. In this case, after saturation, further increasing the amount of precursor by increasing the pulse time does not increase the growth rate as the maximum capacity has been achieved. In the present work, we have related the growth rate and precursor pulse time to the adsorption capacity and concentration of the chemisorption process that occurs in ALD through the enhanced ASST model.",

The ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is a probabilistic technique initially proposed by Dorigo (Dorigo, 1992; Dorigo and Di Caro, 1999). The inspiration for this metaheuristic optimization method was the foraging behavior of the real ants where the cooperation of some simple, independent, and asynchronous agents results in finding a good solution to a problem at hand. Real ants randomly look for food in the vicinity of their nests, and if one of them locates a food source, on the way back to the nest, it releases a chemical substance named pheromone. The pheromone will act as an indirect way of communication between ants since it attracts the other members of the colony to follow the same path. As the pheromone will evaporate over time, only the routes that were used more frequently will remain attractive due to a higher concentration of pheromone. Pheromone evaporation has an advantage that the unfavorable routes will be forgotten over time, and this reduces the chance of finding a locally optimal solution. Therefore, the shorter the routes, the more attractive they are for the ants, and these routes will have higher concentrations of pheromone than longer paths. Consequently, more ants will be attracted to the shorter routes in the future, and the ant colony will hopefully discover the shortest path.",

In ACO algorithms, artificial ants as the stochastic candidate for solution construction procedures utilize a pheromone model and possibly available heuristic information of the mathematical model. The only way of communication among the artificial ants is the artificial pheromone trails (i.e., numeric values). A similar mechanism to the evaporation of the pheromone trail of the real ants would be pheromone decay, which allows the artificial ants to forget the past history and focus on new promising search directions. According to the information learned in the preceding iteration, the pheromone values are updated and leads to very good and, hopefully, a globally optimal solution. Diwekar and Gebreslassie (Diwekar and Gebreslassie, 2016; Gebreslassie and Diwekar, 2015) derived a new variant of ant colony optimization called EACO, which is used in this work to solve the combinatorial problem of designing novel precursors for ALD. In EACO, a better  $n$ - dimensional uniformity property of Hammersley Sequence Sampling (HSS) is used to generate the random numbers, which improves the performance of the conventional ACO algorithm for combinatorial, continuous, and mixed variable optimization problems (Diwekar and Ules, 2000).

The step involves selecting the number for each group and the temperature to generate the precursor molecules. Once the precursor molecule is generated, the CAMD predicts the precursor properties, such as the activity coefficients and the growth rate. Then, the predicted properties are examined by molar balance equations, constraints, and thermodynamic conditions.

The termination criteria are the maximum number of iterations (MAXITER), the maximum number of consecutive iterations with no improvement of the objective function (CONITER), and tolerance (EPS). The solution archive (SArc) is initiated using the HSS technique, which has a dimension of  $ks$  by the number of decision variables (NDIM).

A Gaussian function is used to determine the weight of each solution according to their rank in the solution archive. The termination criteria are tested in the second part of the algorithm. If the termination criteria are not satisfied, an ant selects one of the solutions in the solution archive probabilistically as a solution construction guide. The solution guide is selected by comparing the probability value of the selected solution and a random number.

In this way, minimizing the original equality and inequality constraints and that of the new constraint from the objective become comparable. A penalty function is created by using the comparable property of the two. In some cases, the penalty function is created by a weighted sum of original objective function and constraints. In this way, the penalty function balances its penalty weight between the transformed objective function and constraint violation. This penalty function becomes the new objective function. Because of its simplicity, the oracle penalty function is used extensively. An example of the implementation of the oracle penalty function can be found in a study by Schluter and Gerdts (Schluter and Gerdts, 2010).",

Since the configuration of the designed molecule that dictates the amount adsorbed is not known a priori, we have used the number of moles remained in the bulk phase after ALD as a decision variable instead of the initial number of moles.

All calculations are performed on a substrate weight of  $0.65\\mathrm{g}$ . At each iteration, we started with the given number of initial moles. From the number of moles adsorbed at equilibrium, we select a subset of functional groups and temperature and ensure that the thermodynamic equilibrium of adsorption process (Eq.

The highest growth rate from TDMAT (i.e.,1.20  $\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$ ) has been reported in the deposition temperature of  $50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , where the coreactant was water (Xie et al., 2007). Besides,  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  results in a rather high growth rate  $(0.75\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle})$  at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  when it reacts with water (Leem et al., 2014). However, the byproducts of  $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  are corrosive (Hwang, 2014), which is not desirable, and it is better to be substituted. TEMAT is reported to have a growth rate of  $0.55\\mathrm{\\AA / cy - }$  cle in reaction with  $\\mathrm{O_3}$ , but it needs a high saturation pulse time (10 s) (Katamreddy et al., 2008), which leads to long process time. The growth rate from  $\\mathrm{Ti(OMe)_4}$ $(0.50\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle})$  is comparable with that of TEMAT with a much lower saturation time (0.6 s). However,  $\\mathrm{Ti(OMe)_4}$  is only functional in high temperatures  $(250 - 300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$  (Pore et al., 2004). The high temperatures are not desired in many cases such as when the substrate is organic (Shahmohammadi et al., 2020b, 2020a). Hence, there is still the need for a precursor, which would result in a high growth rate at low temperatures with not so long saturation dose. As can be seen in Table 11, three of the designed precursors result in high growth rates  $(1.39\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle})$  at temperatures as low as room temperature (Ranks 8- 10). It is worth mentioning that the lowest predicted growth rate from theoretically designed precursors in this work is  $1.23\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$  at  $67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (rank 41), which is still higher than, although close to, the highest reported value from the existing precursors (i.e.,  $1.20\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$ ). In the future, these precursors will be synthesized and tested experimentally, and a more detailed property study will be performed.",

        "text": "In this study, we have developed a technology for the design of novel precursor materials with enhanced properties for ALD. An ALD precursor material comprises functional groups and the structural and functional properties of the precursor depend on those groups. In the first part of this paper, four precursors, i.e., TDMAT, TDEAT, TDEAH, and TDMAH, which are commonly used in ALD, are divided into functional groups, and the proposed GCM is applied to obtain their interaction parameters with the substrate and with each other. Using experimental data of the ALD growth rate and the EACO technique, the UNIFAC interaction parameters for the groups are computed. The interaction parameters are used for the theoretical estimation of the growth rate at different precursor pulse times. The estimated values are found to be in good agreement with experimental results. Group interaction parameters calculated from one precursor used for predicting accurate growth rate from other precursors shows the usefulness of the proposed theory. In the second part of this paper, the CAMD framework was used to design ALD precursors that predicted an improved growth rate of ALD using the properties of the functional groups that have been developed by the GCM. The optimal design of novel precursors has been achieved by solving an MINLP problem. The MINLP problem was successfully solved using EACO algorithm. The CAMD algorithm for precursor design maximized the growth rate of the deposited material subjected to structural feasibility, thermodynamic correlation, as well as process conditions and other constraints. The proposed methodology was tested successfully for the design of precursors for ALD of titanium on a silicon substrate. Forty- one unique precursors were designed, and ten precursor molecules were selected based on the predicted growth rate values. These molecules are possibly the best candidates that can be used in an ALD process. All of the designed molecules result in a higher growth rate compared to existing precursors, while satisfying the operating conditions, with the best possible designed precursor predicted a  $40\\%$  higher growth rate than the known one. This method can be applied for the design of ALD precursors of any metals and metal oxides. Once a comprehensive database of UNIFAC interaction parameters in bulk and the ASS phases is obtained, the optimal design of novel precursor materials will become possible on a large scale. A cost analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.",
