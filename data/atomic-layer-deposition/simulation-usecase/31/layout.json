Moreover, Shaeri et al.8 used a three- dimensional and transient finite volume model to optimize the flow patterns and deposition rates in two different precursor injection configurations. They noticed that GPC increases as the temperature of the substrate is increased and stated that the larger GPC is caused by higher reaction rates and concentrations of the oxygen atoms on the substrate.

Later on, Pan et al. used a transient and threedimensional finite volume model along with a surface reaction model based on laminar flow assumption and tworeaction mechanism to study the film growth in a real reactor geometry.11 Based on the numerical and experimental results, the authors observed that the GPC varies based on the location where the sample is placed inside the reactor. The experimental GPC was also noticed to be correlated with the numerically obtained precursor concentration, the highest GPC being in the regions where the precursor concentrations were highest. In the latest work by Pan et al.,12 the authors extend the chemical kinetics mechanism to account for more reactions and investigated the ALD process "

The focus of many of the previous studies has been on model development and comparison or optimizing the film growth. In the present paper, the aim is to study the fluid dynamical aspects inside the reactor chamber by a Reynolds number and injection configuration sweep. It is of particular interest to better understand the precursor mixing characteristics and surface coverage. Thus, we assume that the precursors are transported (convected and diffused) without surface reactions. We then construct spatial maps of the GPC, which depend purely on the precursor concentrations under different conditions. To do this, we solve the carrier gas motion with an unprecedented accuracy. Further, we link the numerical results to experiments and discuss the film growth rate and the fluid dynamical aspects related to it. The objectives of the present work are listed below. First, we investigate the feasibility of scale- resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in ALD studies. Second, we investigate the sensitivity of the sample surface coverage on the Reynolds number under turbulent and laminar conditions. Third, by using the numerical model, we investigate two injection configurations and discuss the results in light of the experiments."

During the precursor pulses, the precursor is injected into one of the carrier gas lines well before the chamber. The carrier gas line, to which the precursors are injected, can be"

The discretization leads eventually to a global system of equations the solution of which offers the time- space dependent velocity and pressure fields. For low- Reynolds number laminar flows, the flow equations can be directly solved while for turbulent, high- Reynolds number flows a turbulence model can be applied to account for the dissipation occurring in the unresolved smallest flow scales below the spatial resolution. In the present work, the relatively low Reynolds number of the flows advocates usage of a scale- resolving approach with minimal amount of modeled numerical dissipation."

However, various unknowns about the exact inlet boundary conditions further motivate to simplify the problem. Hence, as justified by the low Mach number of the flow, the gas is modeled as being incompressible. Additionally, we assume that the gas is isothermal with constant fluid properties in the modeled region. Such assumption is considered to be reasonable since the gases entering the reactor are heated well before the reactor by a large oven surrounding both the reactor and the gas lines. Thereby, the governing equation is the incompressible Navier- Stokes (N- S) equation"

In the convection term, the convective flux is interpolated linearly while the convecting quantities are interpolated by a limited, second order accurate scheme. The diffusion terms are discretized by centered schemes. As discussed in the previous paper by Vuorinen et al.,17 the PISO method includes a diffusive correction term which is removed here as motivated by the previous study.

As the definition shows, under incompressible and isothermal assumption, the flow is essentially characterized by a single nondimensional number, i.e., the Reynolds number alone. By studying a wide range of Reynolds numbers, we are able to investigate the flow behavior as a function of one compact parameter under various operating conditions. For example, the carrier gas flow rates can range from 150 to "

When the flow rate is increased, the highest precursor concentration is shifted more toward the center of the sample and the average concentration is overall more uniform. In addition, two separate islands of high concentration form on the opposite side of the injection. Such islands can be explained by the changed flow pattern in the upper part of the reactor as depicted in Fig. 14(b). As Fig. 14(b) shows, the higher momentum in the injection line causes the jet stream to impinge on the support beam dividing the stream to two recirculation zones on the opposite side of the chamber. Such recirculation zones enhance the transport of precursor concentration to those regions. Eventually, the flow falls down the grid to the sample plane and, in fact, the recirculation pattern explains the island formation process."
