The chart illustrates the energy profile of two reaction pathways involving the interaction between 2(C-O)* and Pt(acac)2, and 2(C-OH)* and Pt(acac)2, respectively. It shows the energy changes along the reaction coordinate, highlighting the activation energies (ΔEa) and reaction energies (ΔEr) for each pathway.
