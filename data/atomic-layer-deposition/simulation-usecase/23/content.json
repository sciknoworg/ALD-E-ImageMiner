In our work, we have found that  $\\mathsf{AlO}_x$  can preferentially encapsulate Pt nanoparticle facets with dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAl) as an ALD precursor. The selectivity originates from the preferential DMAl decomposition mechanism on double hydroxyl sites of the Pt (111) facet, with the subsequent  $\\mathsf{H}_2\\mathsf{O}$  half cycle rapidly removing residual surface intermediates and regenerating the hydroxyls as reaction sites for subsequent cycles. Related microkinetic and experimental results confirm that by the substitution of one methyl in trimethylaluminum (TMA) with an isopropanol radical, DMAl as the precursor can preferentially coat the Pt (111) facets and leave other sites intact through controlling the ALD deposition parameters. The substituent effect in DMAl is also discussed in detail to give guidance to ALD precursor design. Combining theoretical and experimental studies, our work provides for the first time a feasible strategy to achieve selective decoration of  $\\mathsf{AlO}_x$  on Pt nanoparticles via ALD.",

In addition, the surface model with more hydroxyl groups is unfavorable for the adsorption of planar Al precursors (DMAI and TMA).

A decomposition path of DMAI on Pt slabs with double hydroxyls is shown in Scheme 1 and Fig. 4. In this model, two hydroxyls on the slab capture one DMAI as the initial state of further reactions in elementary step 1 (ES1). Previous experimental work indicates that methane and isopropanol are the main products of DMAI decomposition via Al- C and Al- O scission, respectively;35,45- 47 thus, two kinds of dissociation pathways may occur. One involves breaking the bonds between Al and O of isopropanol radical to form an isopropanol along ES2 and then produce a methane molecule after the breakage of the Al- C bond along ES3. Another pathway firstly produces a methane molecule via splitting of the Al- C bond in ES4 and subsequently releases an isopropanol and a methane molecule along ES5 and ES6, respectively. Apparently, two H atoms of hydroxyls can only assist the formation of two molecules, and the residual methyl or isopropanol radical is removed by the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  in the next ALD cycle.

The distance of  $1.82\\mathrm{\\AA}$  between H of the hydroxyl and O of the isopropanol radical and the angle between H of the hydroxyl and O of the isopropanol radical imply the existence of a hydrogen bond, which may be conducive to Al- O cleavage. Regarding the two different subsequent dissociation pathways, we can find that the formation of isopropanol via ES2 is easier than producing a methane in ES4 due to the lower barrier of Al- O bond breakage  $(0.28\\mathrm{eV})$  than of Al- C scission  $(0.64\\mathrm{eV})$ . The two radicals of the residual intermediates are located on two sides of the Al atoms. Specifically, after releasing a methane molecule in ES4, migration of oxygen atoms bonded to the Pt slab leads to a structural reconstruction. The further dissociation of residual precursors along ES3, ES5 and ES6 were also studied, and the related structures of the intermediates are shown in Fig. S3.  $\\dagger$  A reaction barrier of  $1.20\\mathrm{eV}$  occurs for the production of  $\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{AlO}_2^*$  in ES3, while a higher barrier of about  $1.63\\mathrm{eV}$  is needed for the same purpose in ES5. In ES6, methane formation possesses the same barrier as ES5. Herein, it is apparent that",

        "text": "Due to the huge difficulty of further decomposition of residual intermediates after first- step dissociation on the Pt facets discussed above, we investigated the process where water in the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  half cycle decomposes the residual surface intermediates instead of direct dissociation. The process is referred to as the hydrolyzation mechanism, and corresponding reaction diagrams are shown in Fig. 6. On Pt (111), because Al- O bond scission is more kinetically facile than Al- C bond breakage (Fig. 5a),  $(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{O}^*\\mathrm{OH})$  is the primary residual surface intermediate after DMAI first- step decomposition. Accordingly, the hydrolyzation process of  $(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{O}^*\\mathrm{OH})$  at Pt (111) is considered in Fig. 6a. Obviously, the hydrolyzation in which  $(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{O}^*\\mathrm{OH})$  reacts with one gaseous  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  is more favorable; it shows a lower barrier of  $0.16\\mathrm{eV}$  than the direct decomposition (1.20 eV in Fig. 5a). Regarding the transition state (TS), we can see that O of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  gradually approaches the Al atoms, which can elongate the Al- C bond and promote breakage of the Al- C bond. Finally, an H atom of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  binds with the methyl of  $(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{O}^*\\mathrm{OH})$  to form gaseous methane, and the residual hydroxyl of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  binds with the Al atom to regenerate a new hydroxyl site for further  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  growth. In contrast, Al- C scission in ES4 is more favorable than Al- O breakage at the Pt (100) facet, as shown in Fig. 5b, and we only consider the hydrolyzation of the production of ES4  $((\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_5\\mathrm{O})\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)(\\mathrm{O}^*\\mathrm{OH}))$  in Fig. 6b. We found that the H atom firstly binds with O of the residual radical via hydrogen bonding in the transition state, which stretches the Al- O bond and favors its scission. After this, the hydroxyl of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  recombines with the Al- group and an isopropanol is released; this exhibits a lower barrier compared with the direct decomposition process in Fig. 5b. This situation also occurs on edge sites, as shown in Fig. 6c. The hydrogen of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  interacts with the oxygen of isopropanol via hydrogen bonding to assist decomposition of the residual intermediates, with a barrier of  $0.19\\mathrm{eV}$ . Meanwhile, it was also found that the hydrolyzation processes are more exothermic than the direct decomposition of the residual intermediates. Accordingly,  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as the critical assistant for further dissociation not only decreases the decomposition barrier in kinetics, but also makes the process spontaneous by thermodynamics. On the other hand, after the hydrolyzation, similar configurations of the single methyl appear at different Pt facets. A previous study of ALD with a TMA precursor indicated that the remaining single methyl binding Al can be easily removed by the production of  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$  through water exposure.27",

In this temperature window, according to the theoretical results, relatively high temperature brings about simultaneous promotion of the reaction rates at the (111) and edge sites, which weakens the difference in the effects of the  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  deposition rate on the different sites and leads to less remarkable selectivity. On the other hand, at temperatures lower and higher than the realistic temperature window, the surface reaction process may be different from the standard ALD process. At temperatures below  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  (373 K), because the thermal energy is insufficient for a complete binary surface half reaction to occur, the growth rate is very low.

Because the vertex site only occupies a small piece of the surface area of the nanoparticle, the low- coordinated sites are attributed to edge sites. It should be noted that the peak area in Fig. 8 represents the residual Pt sites after a certain number of ALD cycles. It was found that after 3 ALD cycles, the signal of the Pt (111) facets had already disappeared and the signals of Pt (100) and edge sites still existed, which demonstrates that Pt (111) is entirely covered by deposited  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  but that the Pt (100) and edge sites remain available for CO adsorption. Furthermore, the HRTEM image of  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$ - coated Pt nanoparticles with 3 ALD cycles is shown in Fig. S11. Because the amorphous  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  thin film shows ambiguous lattice fringes, we only accounted for the difference in material contrast; we found that the Pt NPs appear to be partially encapsulated, but detailed information about the coated facets was difficult to obtain. Combining HRTEM with the FTIR data, we can conclude that selective decoration of  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  on Pt (111) was achieved in the sample with 3  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  ALD cycles. This experimental phenomenon agrees well with the theoretical predictions of the site preference of  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  growth. Another trend is that as the ALD cycles of  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  continue to increase, the signals of the Pt facets gradually decrease to zero. This situation can be ascribed to the relatively small difference in the intrinsic deposition rates on Pt facets according to the microkinetic results in Fig. 7b. Generally speaking, our experimental results give credible evidence for selective  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  encapsulation at Pt (111) with the DMAI precursor.",

        "text": "According to previous studies on selective encapsulation, we expected that preferential coating on Pt (111) would be favourable for achieving superior thermal stability of Pt NPs. On the other hand, the nonreactive interface of inert  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  and the Pt NPs cannot provide new catalytic sites. Thus, the advantage of partial  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  encapsulation on Pt NPs is achieving stability while sustaining the reactivity for as long as possible. Pt nanoparticles have extensive applications in energy fields in view of their high reactivity towards various chemical processes. Especially, the low- index (111), (100), and (110) facets of Pt have much lower activity than the high- index planes with high densities of atomic steps, ledges, and kinks as active sites for ORR, HOR, HER, etc. However, in a fuel cell environment, Pt particles suffer from Ostwald ripening and agglomeration, which leads to degradation of the Pt NPs and loss of the precious metal catalyst in fuel cell cathodes. Our work may provide a feasible strategy for preferential decoration of specific facets of Pt nanoparticles to balance reactivity and stability, which provides novel guidance for the design of fuel cell catalysts.",

It was found that TMA decomposition proceeds more easily than DMAI decomposition; more importantly, the small barrier difference at different facets indicates no selectivity of ALD with TMA precursor, which agrees well with the experimental results shown in Fig. S13. The behaviour of TMA at Pt nanoparticles was also demonstrated in a previous study. Furthermore, to explain the selectivity difference of TMA and DMAI in nature, we considered the substituent effects on charge distribution and steric hindrance, as shown in Fig. 9. We found that because of the stronger electronegativity of oxygen than of carbon atom, more electrons of the aluminum atom in DMAI transfer to the",

This gives rise to stronger electrostatic interactions between the Al and C atoms of DMAI, which is manifested by the shorter Al- C bond lengths and more difficult Al- C scissions in DMAI compared with those in TMA. Also, the rigid structure of TMA consisting of three  $\\mathrm{Al - CH}_3$  groups cannot release the repulsive interaction from the hydroxylated surface when TMA gradually approaches the adsorption sites. To some extent, this explains the barrierless decomposition of TMA to form  $\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}_6$  at the (111) and edge sites and the weak TMA adsorption as well as the facile TMA dissociation at (100) shown in Fig. S12. In turn, the rotary Al- O- C bonds enable the isopropanol fragment to move far away from the surface through the slight spontaneous relaxation of the local structure, as shown in Fig. 9b; this results in stable DMAI adsorption. In a word, the isopropanol fragment of DMAI gives rise to a strong Al- C bond and stable surface adsorption. The substituent effect in DMAI enables selective deposition of  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$ . Furthermore, the stable adsorption configuration of DMAI at Pt (111) provides favorable Al- O scission through hydrogen bond effects, which enables relatively high deposition activity at Pt (111) compared to the other sites.",

Through our computations, we propose a mechanism of DMAI decomposition on hydroxylated Pt slabs and find that double hydroxyl sites at the Pt facets enable facile DMAI decomposition in comparison with the single hydroxyl model. Furthermore, hydrolyzation of residual surface intermediates is more favorable than their direct dissociation without  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  participation. Further microkinetic analysis and experimental evidence indicates that  $\\mathrm{AlO}_x$  with DMAI as a precursor and Al- containing source can preferentially coat the Pt (111) surface and leave other sites available for catalytic reactions via tailoring the ALD cycles due to the relatively high intrinsic decomposition reactivity of DMAI at the Pt (111) facets. The substituent effect leads to strong Al- C bonding in DMAI and stable DMAI adsorption, which gives clear guidance for ALD precursor design. In general, our work affords new insights into the selective growth mechanism and provides a feasible strategy for selective decoration of Pt nanoparticles.",
