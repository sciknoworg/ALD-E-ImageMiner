The chart illustrates molecular dynamics simulations of three different states (R1, R2, R3) transitioning through transition states (TS1, TS2, TS3) to products (P1, P2, P3). Each state is represented by a set of atoms labeled with their respective positions (Oa, Ob, Oc, H, Si) and their corresponding superscripts indicating their orientation.
