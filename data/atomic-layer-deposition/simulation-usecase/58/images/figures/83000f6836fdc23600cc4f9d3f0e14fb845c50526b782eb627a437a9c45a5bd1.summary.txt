The diagram illustrates the energy changes along a reaction pathway involving ozone (O₃) and oxygen (O₂). It shows the initial state of three ozone molecules at 0 kcal/mol, followed by a series of reactions (R1, R2, R3) and transition states (TS1, TS2, TS3), culminating in the formation of two oxygen molecules at -24.3 kcal/mol.
