The line chart illustrates the Gibbs free energy change (Î”G<sub>298K</sub>) for the SiCl<sub>4</sub> half-reaction on a SiO<sub>2</sub> surface under different catalytic conditions. The chart shows that the presence of a Lewis base catalyst significantly reduces the energy barrier compared to the uncatalyzed reaction.
