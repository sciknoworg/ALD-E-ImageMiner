The chart illustrates two types of pseudorotations in chemical reactions: Berry pseudorotation (BPR) and Surface pseudorotation (SPR). BPR involves a pivot point and transition states leading to TBP structures, while SPR occurs on a SiO2 surface with a catalyst, involving multiple paths to TBP and SP structures.
