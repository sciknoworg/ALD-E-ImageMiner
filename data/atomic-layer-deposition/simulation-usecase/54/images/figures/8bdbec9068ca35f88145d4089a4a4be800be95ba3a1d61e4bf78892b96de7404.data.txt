| (a) Berry pseudorotation (BPR) | A chemical reaction involving a pivot point and transition states (TS) leading to TBP structures. M can be Si, P, etc., and L can be H, F, Cl, etc. M can also be Fe, Co, etc., and L can be CO, PF3, etc. |
| (b) Surface pseudorotation (SPR) | A chemical reaction on a SiO2 surface involving a catalyst, transition states (TS), and paths (Path1, Path2, Path3) leading to TBP and SP structures. The catalyst is Si-OSiCl4. |
