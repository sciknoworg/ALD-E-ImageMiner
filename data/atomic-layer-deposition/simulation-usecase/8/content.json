        "text": "ABSTRACT: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an important technique for thin- film deposition in the last two decades. Zinc oxide thin films, usually grown via diethylzinc (DEZ) and water process, have seen much interest both in application and in theoretical research. The surface processes related to the growth of the thin film are not entirely understood, and the conceptual picture of the ALD process has been contradicted by recent experiments where ligands from the zinc pulse persist on the surface even after extended water pulse exposures. In this work, we investigate the overall growth of the zinc oxide thin films grown via  $\\mathrm{DEZ / H_2O}$  process by modeling the surface chemistry using first principles kinetic Monte Carlo for the first time. The kinetic Monte Carlo allows us to implement density functional theory calculations conducted on the zinc oxide (100) surface into a kinetic model and extract data directly comparable to experimental measurements. The temperature- dependent growth profile obtained from our model is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The onset of thin- film growth is offset from the experimental data because of the underestimation of the reaction barriers within density functional theory. The growth per cycle of the deposited film is overestimated by  $18\\%$  in the kinetic model. Mass gain during an ALD cycle is in qualitative agreement with the experimental quartz- crystal microbalance data. The main mass gain within an ALD cycle is obtained during the DEZ pulse and mass change during the water pulse is negligible. The cause of low film growth at low temperatures is due to the high reaction barriers for ethyl- elimination during the water pulse. This kinetic barrier results in low film growth as no new DEZ can adsorb to the ethyl- saturated surface. At elevated temperatures, ethyl- elimination becomes accessible, resulting in the ideal layer- by- layer growth of the film. However, a large fraction of ethyl- ligands persist on the surface after each ALD cycle even at high temperatures. This results in ethyl- ligands being encapsulated into the film lattice. This is likely due to an incomplete set of reaction pathways, and it is likely that some yet unidentified process is responsible for the elimination of the ethyl- ligands from the surface as the deposition process progresses.",

The graphs are in qualitative agreement with each another. The main mass gain during the ALD cycle comes from the DEZ pulse, and the mass- time graph reaches a saturation. The simulated graph is stable during the purge phases for both DEZ and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ , but in the experimental graph, there is a significant decrease in the deposited mass for both reactants. This is likely due to weakly bound precursors and by- products desorbing from the surface. No such effect is observed in the simulation because no weakly bound species are present during the DEZ pulse and ethane desorption is assumed to be instantaneous. Therefore, the purge phases in the simulated cycle are short in comparison to the experimental cycle as hardly anything of interest occurs in the simulation during the purge phases.",

Temperature has an important role in reducing these defects by increasing the extent to which the ligands are eliminated. The defects can be quantified by calculating the fraction of vacant sites within the lattice. This fraction greatly decreases as a function of temperature but only down to  $20\\%$ .",

As the deposition temperature increases, the removal of the surface ligands becomes feasible, leading to the deposition of the film. The onset of the film growth predicted by the model is offset from the experimental data by  $40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  because of the underestimation of the reaction barriers in DFT.",

During the deposition of the zinc oxide thin film, a substantial amount of ethyl- ligands are incorporated into the lattice structure of zinc oxide. The persistence of ligands is likely to cause some defects and impurities to form in the film. The carbon content of the deposited thin films is known to be low, and thus, it is likely that the ligands encapsulated into the deposited film are removed by a yet unknown mechanism.",
