Zinc oxide thin films, usually grown via diethylzinc (DEZ) and water process, have seen much interest both in application and in theoretical research. The surface processes related to the growth of the thin film are not entirely understood, and the conceptual picture of the ALD process has been contradicted by recent experiments where ligands from the zinc pulse persist on the surface even after extended water pulse exposures. In this work, we investigate the overall growth of the zinc oxide thin films grown via "

The main mass gain within an ALD cycle is obtained during the DEZ pulse and mass change during the water pulse is negligible. The cause of low film growth at low temperatures is due to the high reaction barriers for ethyl- elimination during the water pulse. This kinetic barrier results in low film growth as no new DEZ can adsorb to the ethyl- saturated surface. At elevated temperatures, ethyl- elimination becomes accessible, resulting in the ideal layer- by- layer growth of the film. However, a large fraction of ethyl- ligands persist on the surface after each ALD cycle even at high temperatures. This results in ethyl- ligands being encapsulated into the film lattice. This is likely due to an incomplete set of reaction pathways, and it is likely that some yet unidentified process is responsible for the elimination of the ethyl- ligands from the surface as the deposition process progresses."

ALD is based on sequential, self- terminating gas- solid reactions resulting in uniform, pin- hole free thin films. The reactant gases, precursors, are introduced into the reactor chamber separately, thus avoiding any intermolecular gas- phase reactions. After the surface is saturated with the precursor, the remaining precursors and reaction by- products are purged from the reactor with an inert gas. Because of the self- terminating nature of the surface reactions, the film thickness can be controlled with extreme precision."

This is because of the well- known over- delocalization of the electron density by approximate density functionals. This underestimation produces an error in the absolute values of the reaction barriers. However, assuming that the trends between different processes are correct, the executed sequence of different processes will give reasonable description of the surface reactions. The lower reaction barriers lead to faster surface dynamics, and the surface saturation can be expected to occur in shorter simulation time and at lower temperatures. Subsequent approximations to the reaction rates, such as the adsorption rate, will be conducted in the same direction, that is, to overestimate the rates."

We assume, based on ab initio molecular dynamic simulations of the system, that these processes are fast and assign ad hoc activation energies for these processes. However, the bulk of the simulation time is consumed in the proton diffusion between oxygens and in order to reduce the overall simulation time, the ad hoc barriers for proton diffusion are increased artificially.21 The effects of this approximation are small and are discussed in the Supporting Information."

The actual lattice is 3D, and the first neighbors of a given site i share only one neighbor in common instead of two as is depicted here. The lattice is subject to periodic boundary conditions. The metal and oxygen sites alternate in the lattice (metal sites are colored by light gray, oxygen sites with red). Each zinc and oxygen site is four-coordinated in a tetrahedral configuration. Each site is defined by its location in the lattice, type, cn, and neighbor list. The cn is shown below each lattice box. The bottom row in the figure is the bulk-phase (Zn with cn 4). The bulk is inert, i.e., no process is defined for sites with cn 4. Initially, the surface is covered with low-coordinated hydroxyl groups. Above the surface is the gas phase that is initially filled with vacant (VAC) lattice sites. As the deposition process continues, the simulation produces a crystalline "

This leads to an overestimation of the overall adsorption rate as the molecule is likely to lose at least some of its translational entropy. However, the extent to which the adsorbed molecule loses its entropy is not entirely clear as recent experimental data on the entropy of adsorbed molecules shows. In any case, the overestimation of the adsorption rate is an approximation in favor of the thin- film growth. In a similar fashion, the sticking coefficient "

Steric hindrance sets a limit to how many DEZ and MEZ groups can be present on the surface at any given time, which is crucial if the adsorption of the precursors is to be self- limiting. Assuming that the adsorbed DEZ molecule may freely rotate on the surface, the steric repulsion between adsorbants is the same in all directions and the steric effect can be taken into account by a repulsion sphere the adsorbed molecule projects around itself. The same is true for MEZ fragments."

An ad hoc barrier is then used for the densification process so as to include ethyl- ethyl repulsion and make the ethyl groups avoid one another. The barrier is higher for processes where the cn of the vacant site is negative, that is, when the vacant site is surrounded by ligands. This means that, given the choice, the densification of a MEZ group will occur to a vacant site that has fewer ethyl- ligands in its vicinity. In this way, the zinc fragments prefer to densify to regions with fewer ethyl- ligands present, minimizing steric interaction. Densification is allowed"

The effect of the mask function can be seen here, as the ethyl-ligands tend to avoid one another when densifying to the zinc sublattice. Some of the MEZ remain nondensified.
