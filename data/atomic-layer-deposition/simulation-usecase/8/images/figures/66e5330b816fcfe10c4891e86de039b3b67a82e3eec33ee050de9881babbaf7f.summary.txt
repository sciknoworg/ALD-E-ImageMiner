The chart illustrates the change in overall adsorption energy and the averaged adsorption energy per water molecule as the number of Hâ‚‚O molecules increases. The overall adsorption energy decreases with more molecules, while the averaged adsorption energy per molecule initially decreases and then stabilizes.
