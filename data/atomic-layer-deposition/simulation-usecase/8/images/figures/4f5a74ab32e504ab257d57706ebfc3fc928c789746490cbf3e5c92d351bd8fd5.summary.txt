The line chart illustrates the fraction of sites containing a ligand along the z-axis at different temperatures (27°C, 77°C, 127°C, and 177°C). The highest peak occurs around 5 angstroms for all temperatures, indicating a significant concentration of ligands in this region. As the temperature increases, the overall fraction decreases, with the 27°C curve showing the highest values.
