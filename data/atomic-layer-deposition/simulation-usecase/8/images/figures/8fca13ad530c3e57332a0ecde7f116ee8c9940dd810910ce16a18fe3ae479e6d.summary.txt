The scatter plot compares the growth-per-cycle per angstrom at different temperatures for three methods: Yousfi et al., kMC (average mass), and kMC (average thickness). The data points show a general increase in growth with temperature, with Yousfi et al. having the lowest values and kMC (average thickness) showing the highest.
