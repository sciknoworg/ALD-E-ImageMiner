        "text": "Being able to control the exposure of precursors to the substrate surface is essential towards an optimum Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process. Conventional ALD usually requires large excess of precursors and expensive vacuum chamber in which the precursor exposure can be controlled via the injection pulse duration followed by a delay time. A version of ALD, namely Spatial ALD (SALD), which has the same unique assets as conventional ALD but being faster, vacuum- free, and easier to scale up, has recently attracted much attention. In SALD, precursors are continuously exposed to a moving surface, and thus it is more complicated to tune precursor exposure than with conventional ALD. Here, we present a study on how to control this critical parameter for the deposition of ZnO films using a close- proximity, open- air SALD. Our results are based on both simulations and experiments. A simple physical model supported by Comsol Multiphysics simulations has been developed to study the effect of the substrate velocity as well as the precursor concentration in the carrier gas on film growth rate. We found that the precursor entrainment by the moving substrate induces an asymmetric precursor concentration profile that affects the obtained GPC. Also, we show that the mass density and structural properties of the deposited films depend closely on the film growth rate. For instance, fast growth does not always produce dense films. Indeed, a compromise between the growth rate and the precursor consumption should be considered to obtain both good process efficiency and high- quality films. Our findings are particularly relevant for using SALD in large- scale coating applications, in which high deposition rate and good coating density should be obtained with a minimal ALD precursor consumption.",

Over the past decades, research advances have expanded the use of this surface- controlled layer- by- layer technology beyond microelectronic applications [4,5], including the development of biosensors [6], materials for barrier coatings [7- 11] or energy conversion and storage [12- 18]. However, one of the main drawbacks of ALD is a slow growth rate, which can be attributed to slow purging steps alternatively performed between different precursor injections [19].

        "text": "context, a variation of ALD technique, namely spatial ALD (SALD), has been recently attracting much attention since this ALD- based technology can be applied to deposit materials at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures. Additionally, SALD provides very fast deposition rate and in a scalable fashion, while keeping the unique assets of ALD technology [20- 23]. For instance, SALD is compatible with roll- to- roll technology for fast industrial thin film deposition [24]. The key point of an ALD technology is the possibility of thoroughly controlling the half- reactions between precursors and the substrate surface, and at the same time to minimize the precursor use and optimize the ALD growth rate (expressed in the thickness of the layer deposited on the surface after each ALD cycle, i.e. nm/cycle) [3,25]. In an ideal ALD process, a complete monolayer of precursor molecules would be formed on the substrate surface after each precursor exposure to the substrate surface. In such an adsorption process, the amount of precursor being exposed to the surface (calculated as the product of the precursor exposure time and the precursor concentration) should be appropriately selected to achieve the saturation state of the precursor- substrate surface reaction. The determination of a critical value of the exposure corresponding to such a complete ALD half- reaction is thus necessary. Indeed, since ALD is a self- limiting process, for a given precursor concentration in the gas phase, an exposure time longer than the critical value is not useful but causes a waste of ALD precursors, which are commonly expensive. In conventional ALD, the exposure time usually depends on the chamber/sample size, the concentration of the precursors in the gas phase, the chamber pressure, as well as the substrate temperature.",

        "text": "Contrarily to conventional ALD, in SALD the precursors are continuously injected onto the substrate, for instance from different gas outlets of an injection head. These reactive precursor regions are spatially separated from mixing thanks to inert gas barriers, which are alternatively located between the precursor regions. Given the close distance needed between the injection head and the substrate  $(\\sim 200\\mu \\mathrm{m})$  to avoid precursor cross- talk, this kind of approach is commonly called close- proximity SALD [26,27]. When performing SALD with a moving substrate, the distribution of precursors to the substrate surface will be considerably affected. As a result, controlling the precursor exposure is much more complicated in the case of SALD than in ALD since there is no longer a deposition chamber and the purging step is indeed substituted by passing the substrate through an inert gas region. Obviously, the optimization of the exposure is more critical for metal precursors than for oxidizing agents, especially for large- scale applications since the ALD precursors are usually very expensive. In literature, several approaches related to modeling the ALD deposition reaction, such as adsorption kinetics or surface reaction mechanisms have been proposed [28- 31]. In the case of SALD, Poodt et al. developed a physical model to study the deposition kinetics of  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  when using a rotating SALD injection system [32], in which the exposure time of precursors is simply supposed to be inversely proportional to the rotation frequency. Also, while Deng et al. proposed a model to quantitatively link the film growth throughput and precursor utilization, it is only based on the gas flows and precursor concentration, and other parameter such as the injector- substrate gap or the gas entrainment due to the moving substrate are not taken into account [33]. Finally, the effect of the deposition parameters on the film properties is not discussed in previous works. Thus, in- depth studies to link the optimization of the film growth rate with ALD precursor consumption, taking into account precursor concentration, gas flow values, substrate velocity and deposition gap, and discuss the properties of the films obtained as a function of the parameters used are still needed.",

We remark that the samples deposited with small  $f_{DEZ}$  values ([10 sccm, 30 sccm]) exhibit similar crystalline nanostructure with (100) reflection as the dominant peak. The texture coefficients corresponding to (110) and (002) reflection peaks are rather close to each other, while the value for the (100) peak is almost twice higher, as shown in Fig. 3b.

Fig. 4b shows this fraction for various substrate velocities. As the substrate velocity increases, both an asymmetry and a decrease in DEZ concentration are observed. This can be attributed to two main reasons: i) the gas- entraining effect caused by the moving substrate, and ii) the presence of two adjacent exhaust channels located next to the DEZ outlet.

(10) for the  $GPC$  of ZnO films deposited at different [DEZ] values as a function of substrate velocity,  $\\nu$ . Our model properly fits the data of the high and intermediate substrate velocities for various DEZ bubbling flow rates (15, 30 and 50 sccm). Conversely, it can be observed that the growth rates deviate from the theoretical model at low substrate velocities, which correspond to the longer exposure time. As discussed in Fig. 2, an extra injection of precursors to the substrate surface can create condensation if the subsequent purging step is not sufficiently long. This fact was not taken into account in our simple model, yielding an underestimation of the growth rate at low substrate velocities. The same argument could also explain the increase of the static growth rate,  $K_{1}$ , obtained at higher values of  $f_{DEZ}$  (30 or 50 sccm compared to 15 sccm). Indeed, the  $N_2$  surging flow should be adapted for each value of  $f_{DEZ}$  and substrate velocity. However, in this work, it was maintained constant at 150 sccm to keep the gas flow balance at all the outlets of the injection head. Consequently, this value may not be sufficient to purge the excess physisobed precursor molecules in the case of high [DEZ]. Concerning the fitting parameters, while  $K_{1}$  is associated with the static growth rate,  $X$  and  $Y$  do not have a direct physical meaning.

Therefore, according to Eqs. (7) and (8), high values of  $k_{ss}$  and  $\\nu_{c}$  are expected. Since  $k_{ss}$  characterizes how easily the DEZ flow can be entrained by the moving substrate, the observed decreasing trend of  $k_{ss}$  versus  $f_{DEZ}$  indicates that the growth rate of  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  is less affected by the substrate velocity if higher DEZ bubbling flow is used. The opposite trend is observed for  $\\nu_{c}$ . A higher value of this characteristic velocity is expected given the fact that a fast substrate velocity can be used while maintaining a constant  $t_{res}^{eff}$ . From another point of view, the optimization of the SALD process concerns the improvement of the growth rate with as little precursor consumption as possible. Three pivotal parameters should be taken into account: growth rate  $GPC$  (nm/cycle), precursor consumption that is directly proportional to  $f_{DEZ}$  (sccm) and deposition time  $t_{dep}$  (s), of which the latter is related to the substrate velocity  $\\nu$ $(\\mathrm{cm} / \\mathrm{s})$ .

On the other hand, using the low value of  $f_{DEZ}$  (15 sccm) can save precursor, however, the disadvantage is a longer deposition time to maintain a constant process efficiency. Remarkably, using a moderate value of  $f_{DEZ}$  (30 sccm) yields a significantly higher value of efficiency  $\\eta_{dep}$ .

This parameter depends directly on the substrate velocity, the geometric design of the injection head, as well as the carrier gas flow rate. A simple physical model has been developed to study the effect of the substrate velocity and the precursor concentration in the carrier gas  $\\left(\\mathrm{DEZ}\\right)$  on the growth rate of the deposited ZnO films. Comsol Multiphysics results show that the entrainment of the precursor molecules by the moving substrate induces an asymmetry in the  $\\left[\\mathrm{DEZ}\\right]$  profile that affects the obtained growth per cycle (GPC). When studying thoroughly the experimental data based on the effect of  $\\left[\\mathrm{DEZ}\\right]$  and the substrate velocity at constant  $\\left[\\mathrm{DEZ}\\right]$ , we found that an excess of physisorbed precursor molecules on the substrate surface in the case of high  $\\left[\\mathrm{DEZ}\\right]$  can be indirectly observed via the clear variation of the film growth rate when either increasing  $\\left[\\mathrm{DEZ}\\right]$  or decreasing the substrate velocity beyond a certain value. The agreement between experimental observations and the model appears very good. Finally, we have also shown that the mass density of the deposited ZnO films depends closely on the substrate velocity, and that a fast growth rate does not always produce dense films. Indeed, a compromise between growth rate and precursor consumption should be considered to obtain both a high film density and a good process efficiency, of which the latter is proposed for the first time to quantify such analysis in SALD. The simple and original approach presented can pave the way to better understand thin- film growth using any SALD system, since it provides a comprehensive guide on optimizing growth rate, film density, and precursor consumption. This is indeed crucial when using SALD for large- scale coating applications.",
