        "text": "Plasma- enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE- ALD) has been applied to prepare high- quality ultrathin films for microelectronics, catalysis, and energy applications. The possible pathways for  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  PE- ALD using aminosilanes and  $\\mathbf{O}_2$  plasma have been investigated by density functional theory calculations. The silane half- reaction between  $\\mathrm{SiH_4}$  and surface  $- \\mathrm{OH}$  is very difficult and requires a high activation free energy of 57.8 kcal  $\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1}$ . The introduction of an aminosilane, such as BDMAS, can reduce the activation free energy to 11.0 kcal  $\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1}$  and the aminosilane plays the role of a self- catalyst in  $\\mathrm{Si} - \\mathrm{O}$  formation through the relevant half- reaction. Among the various species generated in  $\\mathbf{O}_2$  plasma,  ${}^3\\mathbf{O}_2$  is inactive towards surface silane groups, similar to ordinary oxygen gas. The other three species,  ${}^1\\mathbf{O}_2$ ,  ${}^1\\mathbf{O}$ , and  ${}^3\\mathbf{O}$ , can strongly oxidize surface silane groups through one- step or stepwise pathways. In the  ${}^3\\mathbf{O}$  pathway, the triplet must be converted into the singlet and follow the  ${}^1\\mathbf{O}$  pathway. Meanwhile, both  ${}^1\\mathbf{O}$  and  ${}^3\\mathbf{O}$  can decay to  ${}^1\\mathbf{O}_2$  and enter into the relevant oxidation pathway. The concept of self- catalysis of aminosilanes may be invoked to design and prepare more effective Si precursors for  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  ALD. At the same time, the mechanism of strong surface oxidation by  $\\mathbf{O}_2$  plasma may be exploited in the PE- ALD preparation of other oxides, such as  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ ,  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ ,  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$ , and  $\\mathrm{TiO}_2$ .",

This selfcatalysis by an amino ligand is similar to room temperature ALD (RT- ALD) of  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  using Lewis- base catalysts, such as ammonia and pyridine, whereby the N atom can interact with hydroxyl  $(- \\mathrm{OH})$  groups on the surface through strong  $\\mathrm{N}\\cdot \\cdot \\mathrm{H}$  hydrogen bonding.10- 18 The formation of one Si- O bond requires one amino group and one - OH group. Because the bis- aminosilane precursor has two amino ligands and the stoichiometric ratio with respect to  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  is  $1:2$  BDMAS can produce highly pure and stoichiometric  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  films. Recently, it was reported that the half- reaction between another bis- aminosilane precursor, BTBAS, and surface - OH has a low activation energy of about  $10.0\\mathrm{kcal}\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1}$  , and this bis- aminosilane also showed similar catalytic behavior.27 A mono- aminosilane precursor, DMAS, can also catalyze the growth of  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  . The self- catalytic process is similar to the first Si- O formation in the BDMAS half- reaction, proceeding via a 4MR TS and producing  $- \\mathrm{SiH_3}$  . Similar to BDMAS, a trisminosilane precursor, TDMAS, can also catalyze the formation of two Si- O bonds. Our experiments on  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  PE- ALD using TDMAS at ambient and low temperatures further proved the self- catalysis by aminosilane through its amino ligand (see the experimental details and product characterization of  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  PE- ALD in the  $\\mathrm{ESI}\\dagger$  ). However, the third amino group  $\\mathrm{(- N(CH_3)_2)}$  of TDMAS still remains on the surface and is subsequently oxidized by  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma, inevitably leading to carbon and nitrogen contamination of the  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  film.28 Due to severe steric hindrance, reaction of the tetrakis- aminosilane precursor, TKDMAS, with surface - OH groups to form a  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  film is hampered.29 In order to design more effective Si precursors for  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  ALD, the best approach would seem to be an elaboration of those based on bis- aminosilane, such as BEMAS and BTBAS.",

Due to strong interactions between the active species and the surface, highly energetic  ${}^{1}\\mathrm{O}$  can decay to  ${}^{3}\\mathrm{O}$  and then follow the relevant  ${}^{3}\\mathrm{O}$  pathway. Both  ${}^{3}\\mathrm{O}$  and  ${}^{1}\\mathrm{O}$  can produce  ${}^{1}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  and enter into the oxidation pathway thereof. We anticipate that the concept of self- catalysis of aminosilanes may be invoked in the design of more effective  $\\mathrm{Si}$  precursors for  $\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , and the mechanism of strong surface oxidation by  $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$  plasma may improve PE- ALD methodologies for the preparation of other oxides, such as  $\\mathrm{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ ,  $\\mathrm{HfO}_{2}$ ,  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$ , and  $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ .",
