| (a) | A molecular structure showing Ti, Si, O, H atoms with bond lengths and angles labeled. |
| (b) | A simplified view of two O atoms bonded to a central atom, possibly representing a different molecule. |
| (c) | A molecular structure with Ti, I, O, H atoms, showing longer bond lengths compared to (a). |
| (d) | A molecular structure with Ti, O, H atoms, showing a different arrangement and bond lengths. |
