The image displays three molecular structures labeled (a), (b), and (c). Each structure consists of a central titanium atom (yellow) bonded to nitrogen atoms (blue) and hydrogen atoms (purple). The distances between the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms are indicated as 3.59 Å in (a), 2.99 Å in (b), and 3.59 Å in (c).
