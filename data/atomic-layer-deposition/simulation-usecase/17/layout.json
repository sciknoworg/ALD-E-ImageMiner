This review article explains and simplifies two simulation methodologies, molecular dynamics and the density functional theory (DFT), in solving atomic layer deposition problems computationally. We believe that these simulation methodologies are powerful tools that can be utilised in atomic layer deposition. DFT is used to solve problems in surface science and catalysis (predicting surface energy, adsorption energy, charge transfer, etc.), semiconductors (band structure, defect bands, band gap, etc.), superconductors (electron- phonon coupling, critical transition temperature), and molecular electronics (conductance, current- voltage characteristics). Molecular dynamics (MD) is used to predict the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of a material. Of interest in this article is a review where different material problems emanating from atomic layer deposition from these fields have been addressed by DFT and MD. Selected publications are discussed where DFT and MD have been successfully applied in atomic layer deposition (and related processes in some instances). The applications of DFT stretch from binding energy calculations of molecules and the solid band structure in chemistry and physics, respectively, computing the electron density up to determining the properties of a many- electron system. Also highlighted in this review study are the challenges that DFT and MD simulations must overcome."

It can be used to produce ultrathin films [3,4]. ALD can be studied and analysed experimentally and by computational modelling and simulations. Experiments are expensive to run since the ALD equipment and other raw materials are expensive. They can also pose hazards because sometimes gases used or released in the chemical reactions are toxic and occasionally explosive. Modelling and simulations reduce drastically the costs involved in experiments. ALD [2,5- 9] has grown to become a vital manufacturing technique in many fields of nanotechnology, [10- 12] semiconductor processing [13- 16], microelectronics [17- 21], electrocatalysis [22- 24], and protective coatings [25- 31]. ALD is a very powerful method of fabricating nanostructures and nanomaterials, regardless of their complex geometric shapes, with uniform films and coatings at the nano, micro, and atomic levels [7,13,25,32- 34]. The computer simulation of molecular systems has recently increased in academic and industrial research [35]. Computational modelling and simulation methodologies have several advantages over experiments. Some of these are low costs because they do not require costly equipment and raw materials. Because of their versatility, they may be used to investigate and analyse practically any material virtually, including those that produce toxic gases during their manufacture. They can be performed almost anywhere if adequate computational power is available. Atomic layer deposition can be modelled and simulated using various modelling and simulation methodologies such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), density functional theory (DFT), Knudsen number, Monte Carlo method, and"

It is essential to know which methodology one must adopt in modelling and simulating ALD. This review article looks at the two primary modelling and simulation methodologies that are employed in ALD: the DFT and molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics uses Newton's laws of motion to simulate forces of attraction and the position of molecules, while the DFT uses quantum mechanics principles to simulate the interaction of molecules and atoms. The problems that one can expect to solve using DFT in atomic layer deposition are predicting the surface energy of a material, adsorption energy calculations, charge transfer predictions, band structure prediction in semiconductors, defect bands identification, band gap calculation in semiconductors, electron- phonon coupling prediction in superconductors, critical transition temperature prediction in superconductors, and conductance and current- voltage characteristics in molecular electronics. MD is used to predict the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of a material. Other review articles have discussed DFT/MD for ALD. These include the studies by Oviroh et al. [2], where they discuss various developments in ALD and why researchers opt for computational methodologies, Elliott et al. [36], where various classes of ALD processes based on mechanistic information from DFT are discussed, and Gupta et al. [37], who review various advances in materials design using ALD in the energy application fields. The review will also consider where the methods have been applied, their pros, and challenges to date."

The process is based on sequential self- limiting chemical reactions. In an ALD process, a substrate on which thin films must be deposited is placed inside a reaction chamber at a specific pressure and temperature. The first precursor is then injected into the reaction chamber and reacts with the surface of the substrate forming a thin layer. By- products and excess first precursor molecules are eliminated by blowing in inert gas. The second precursor is then blown in. A chemical reaction occurs between the first precursor surface on the substrate and the second precursor. The excess precursor molecules and by- products are also carried away by the inert gas blown in after this reaction. The cycle of precursor "

Particle ALD is closely related to the conventional atomic layer deposition process but is more concerned about coating the entire particle surface, including the surfaces of nanoparticles. It utilises the principles of ALD and applies them to the complex geometry coating of particles that are spherical in nature. The temperature range for this process varies with the nature of precursors and substrates but is usually lower than that of thermal and metal ALD. Plasma- enhanced ALD uses plasma to reduce the temperature required to vapourise molecules.

Among the different thin film fabrication processes, ALD is steadily growing to be the preferred thin- film deposition technique. Atomic layer deposition has several advantages over the other fabrication techniques, like precise atomic control of deposited film thickness, homogeneousness of thicknesses deposited even on complex three- dimensional surfaces, relatively lower system temperatures, and improved electronic properties of devices manufactured from films deposited by ALD [2]. Tables 1 and 2 compare the atomic layer deposition process with other thin- film fabrication techniques."

Nanostructured materials can be categorised into four classes: carbon- based, inorganic- based, organic- based, and composite- based nanomaterials. Jeevanandam et al.

In this review, we discuss briefly the ALD process on carbon- based and inorganic- based nanostructures."

Carbon nanotubes are the strongest one- dimensional materials. Graphene has good electrical conductivity, high tensile strength, high transparency, and is the thinnest known two- dimensional material. Nanomaterials are applied in conducting materials, transducers, biochemical sensors, electronics, and conducting materials. ALD has been used to coat and decorate nanostructures and has proved to be the coating technique of choice for carbon- based nanostructures because of its conformal and self- limiting surface deposition. The first use of ALD to coat carbon- based nanostructures, in this case, carbon nanotubes, was reported by Javey et al. [63] in 2002. The group deposited high- k dielectric zirconium oxide thin films onto single- walled carbon nanotubes. Lee et al. [64] reported the homogeneous coating of multi- walled CNTs (MWCNTs) with "

This substrate is usually pre- formed using advanced 3D nanofabrication techniques such as direct laser writing (DLW), lithography, block- copolymer (BCP), electrospinning, phase- mask interference lithography (PMIL), and multibeam interference lithography (MBIL). These 3D nanofabrication processes chiefly yield polymer- based nanonetwork structures. Before these polymers can be applied in various fields, they need to be improved. These polymers have poor mechanical resistance and poor thermal resistance. Typical methods used to fill the interconnected pores are electrochemical deposition, chemical vapour deposition, and sol- gel reaction. Functional inorganic materials such as ceramics and metals are used to fill the "

The main challenge of these filling techniques discussed earlier is that they lead to the elimination of the porous structure of 3D nanonetworks in a composite state. That is where ALD comes in. The feature of conformal coating of ALD of the surface of porous structures is desirable. Surface properties can be changed, and the pore size can be reduced while we maintain a porous structure. With ALD, it is possible to create a lightweight and highly porous material. It is important to maintain the least possible process temperature below the polymer melting point temperature to preserve the 3D nanostructure during atomic layer deposition of inorganic thin films on 3D nanonetworks [66- 68].

Nowadays, it is used in binding energy calculations of molecules and the band structure of solids in chemistry and physics, respectively [74,75]. In atomic layer deposition, the DFT can be used to explore the reaction mechanism between the first precursor and the substrate. It can be used to calculate the electron density and electronic configurations at this stage. Where the first precursor fails to bond with the surface of the substrate, DFT can be used to explain why this happens. DFT calculations can also be used to improve the conditions of the substrate so that it is favourable for bonding with the precursor. After purging the by- products and excess first precursor, the second precursor is pumped into the reaction chamber. DFT can be used to map the reaction pathway between the first and second precursors. It can be used to predict the nature of the reaction and the by- products from this reaction. DFT can be applied at the end of the ALD process to predict the thin film's mechanical and electrical properties. DFT can be used to validate the experimental conclusions, differentiate between possible opportunities to be explored, or create a foundation for experiments [23]. DFT aims at calculating the electron"

In this cycle, step A entails exposing the surface of the substrate to inhibitor molecules, whereas steps B and C are the usual conventional ALD process steps. Inhibitor molecules deactivate certain areas of the substrate and prevent the growth of films on those regions during the ALD cycles (see Figure 4). ASALD has a great potential to be applied in self- aligned manufacturing systems for future- generation nanoelectronics [52,95]. In their article, Mameli et al. used DFT calculations to understand better the chemoselective Hacac mechanism of adsorption at the molecular scale. The team evaluated the structures, and their related relative energies for the stationary points along the minimum energy paths (MEPs) needed to absorb Hacac inhibitor on aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide. Figure 5 shows the DFT (GGA/PBE- D3) [96] of minimum energy paths (MEPs) needed to absorb Hacac on (a) aluminium oxide "

They also used DFT in conjunction with the computerised numerical technique and the dissociation of bond ligand automation tool from the Schrödinger material science package [129- 131] to study and evaluate the thermal stability and reactivity of the precursors. The reason for the use of DFT is that they knew it as a promising technique to understand the chemistry of innovative ALD precursors and enabling precursor development, which has high selectivity and reactivity and thermal stability [132- 134]. By using DFT simulation and calculation, Mohlala et al. predicted Ti tetrahalide (fluorine, chlorine, and iodine) precursors through the use of Schrödinger's automated enumeration tool. They predicted that a library of three halides forms 81 different complexes, 15 of which have exceptional ligand compositions [128]. The precursors were improved utilising DFT as realised in Jaguar [131]. Figure 11 shows an illustration of 15 of the precursors."

The accuracy of the adopted approximation governs the usefulness of their DFT simulations for several properties [141]. The precise handling of electron correlation founds a significant challenge in DFT. Electron correlation is frequently described with regard to a Hartree- Fock wave function. According to the variational principle, the lowest energy orbitals may be found by leveraging the HF wave function, a single- configuration wave function derived by employing the variational principle. The difference between a system's exact energy and its HF energy at the entire basis set limit is typically used to calculate electron correlation energy [141]."

By substituting nonlocal high- frequency exchange for a portion of the local exchange- correlation functional, the self- interaction error can be reduced [85,144]. DFT does not treat discrete electrons in precisely identical ways but uses their total density. This means any one- electron system does not play a distinct unique role in DFT. The Coulomb energy for one electron is cancelled by the exchange energy [145]. The orbital rotation operator that is used for generating a foundation for time- dependent DFT equations generates only the configurations that are singly excited with regard to the ground state. This means higher order excitation states (e.g., the excitations with a high degree of double excitation character) are excluded in time- dependent DFT. However, they can be incorporated through the exchange- correlation functional [142]."

It can predict the binding energy between the substrate and the first precursor molecules. In the second stage where the by- products and excess first precursor are purged, MD can be applied to predict the mechanism of removal. In the third stage where the second precursor is pumped into the reaction chamber, MD simulations can be used to predict the nature of the reaction, the binding energy between the first and second precursor atoms, and the stability of the bond. It can also be applied in the fourth stage the same way as the third stage since these purging stages have the same principles. Molecular dynamics can be used to predict the thermodynamic properties of the deposited thin- film material, based on intermolecular interactions. The deposited thin film can be analysed by MD simulations to predict free binding energy, the heat of vapourisation, and boiling point. According to Sator [157], the molecular dynamics method is valid in both equilibrium and non- equilibrium physical phenomena. Molecular dynamics is a useful computational approach that may be used in simulating various physical phenomena [158,159] if there is satisfactory computation power. Besides ReaxFF [70,160- 162], other computational software that can be used in molecular dynamics simulations are LAMMPS [163- 166], NAMD [167], GROMACS, CHARMM [167], and AMBER [168,169]. The molecular dynamics method uses Newton's equations of motion to describe the motion of molecules. It is simple and logical [170]. Simulation of particle flow on a computer MD program follows the equations of motion [157,171]. The force exerted by an external field and ambient molecules is defined by the following equation of motion:"

In their research article, Becker and Sierka [70] presented a simulation structure for plasma- enhanced atomic layer deposition processes by compounding the Monte Carlo [157,179] deposition algorithm and structure relaxation using MD to account for the steric interruption and the surface overlap restrictions consistent with the actual step of precursor deposition. The structure was relaxed after each step of attachment, using either local structure optimisation or short- simulated annealing using MD. They calculated the chemisorption energy and used it to compute the acceptance criterion using the Metropolis- Hastings rule [181]. They also applied their simulation procedure to study the PEALD synthesis of silicon dioxide thin films employing a bis- diethylaminosilane precursor. Preliminary examination of the precursor products with hydroxylated silicon dioxide surfaces using DFT calculations showed a strong reliance of reaction energies on the structure of the surface, specifically for the precursor that was bonded to two oxygen atoms at the surface. Their PEALD simulations showed that the precursor binding to one oxygen atom at the surface favours amorphous layer growth, many "

Ribonucleic acid aptamers are oligonucleotides that connect with high specificity and attraction to targeted ligands [185]. It was observed in their simulations, as well as in the experiments, that the theophylline binding site may be located in a variety of binding- incompetent states, all of which lack a binding pocket capable of holding theophylline. Binding- incompetent states can become binding competent by rearranging the binding site structurally on a period ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds."

These simulations, however, may take several days depending on the size of molecules under analysis [201]. The atom (or molecules) quantity in the system determines the time scale available to the simulation problem, hence the time- scale problem severity [174,202]. This governs the speed at which investigations can be conducted. The time- scale problem is the major reason why brute- force molecular dynamics simulations are not practical when investigating crystal nucleation."

They complement ALD experiments but have the advantage of significantly reducing the financial burden of doing experiments. Their other benefit is that they can be used to analyse very complex structures and reactions that may be otherwise very dangerous to conduct experimentally in the lab. Through simulations, any problem can be interrogated regardless of practical limitations inhibiting experiments, including hypothetical situations that could not be realised through experiments under any conditions. However, it should be noted that computer simulations remain a theoretical approach whose value lies when new hypotheses and predictions generated can then be subjected to experimental analysis and validation. DFT can be applied in molecule binding energy calculations in chemistry and the solids band structure in physics, for computing the electron density, and for determining the many- electron system properties. DFT can answer problems of understanding material properties in surface science and catalysis, semiconductors, superconductors, and molecular electronics. Molecular dynamics can be used to interpret biochemical data on repressor- operator binding, interpret biophysical data on membrane properties, refine structures based on nuclear magnetic resonance, refine structures based on crystallographic X- ray or neutron diffraction data, and predict structural and free energy changes. Molecular dynamics can predict the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of materials. Several papers have been published where these simulation techniques managed to predict the outcome of experiments successfully. One must be able to distinguish between the discussed methodologies and pick "

These methodologies can be used to prove and validate results from experiments and predict the outcome from experiments. Most MD and DFT simulation packages are robust and need adequate computing power. Substantial time is required for one to learn the software and produce accurate simulation results. Since the simulation results do not always agree with experimental results, it is important to couple simulations with experiments where possible.
