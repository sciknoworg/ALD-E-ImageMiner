The line chart illustrates the energy changes (in kJ/mol) for two precursors, SiH<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and SiH<sub>2</sub>DMA<sub>2</sub>, interacting with surfaces labeled as NH<sub>2</sub> and OH. The chart highlights the transition states (TS) and their corresponding activation energies.
