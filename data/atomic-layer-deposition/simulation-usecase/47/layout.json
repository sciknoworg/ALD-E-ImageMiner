Accordingly, many technological roadblocks in fact come down to limitations in materials processing. For example, although steel had been known since antiquity, it was only with the development of the cost- efficient Bessemer process in the 1850s that steel- reinforced skyscrapers could be built.[1] In today's electronics industry, further advancements in speed and efficiency are dependent on improving the resolution of materials processing during the manufacture of electronic chips.[2] As electronic devices become smaller, specific materials must be deposited, patterned and etched at the nanoscale. There is thus a need to coat 3D structures with nanometer- thin films of various materials, within the stringent reliability and uniformity tolerances of semiconductor manufacturing. Atomic layer deposition (ALD), a special type of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), allows the growth of such ultrathin and conformal films of inorganic materials by using sequential, self- limiting reactions.[3]"

ALD precursors undergo selflimited reactions with the substrate or growing film, which terminate when the substrate is covered with fragments of the new precursor. In this way, growth is limited to a fraction of a monolayer in each cycle of precursor pulses. ALD cycles are repeated until the desired film thickness is obtained. ALD is therefore uniquely suited to growing nanometer- thin films of high quality in a controlled fashion, uniformly coating any substrate geometry over length scales from nanometers to meters. A comprehensive summary of ALD precursors, processes and materials is given in a recent review.[5] ALD- grown layers are now used for electroluminescent displays, transistors, memory chips, disk read- write heads and light- emitting diodes. Nonelectronics applications are also emerging, such as passivation layers in solar cells, thin film batteries, diffusion barriers for packaging and anti- corrosion coatings."

In general these gas- surface reactions can be described as dissociative chemisorption, where precursors react in multiple steps with functionalized surfaces and by- products desorb. Whether the desired purity of target film can be achieved depends on what by- products desorb. Similar chemical reactions occur in heterogeneous catalysis,[6] but in ALD continuous turnover of the reaction is not desired. Instead, many ALD processes exploit the inertness of ligands, assumed or known from experience, to ensure saturation of the surface in each precursor pulse (i.e., the self- limiting growth reaction), as well as thermal stability of the precursor (to avoid uncontrolled gas- phase reactions)."

Many different reactions are in continual competition during the various phases of the cyclic growth experiment, responding to the changes in gas pressure and concentration of surface species. The outcome of this competition is of course determined by kinetics and for a successful ALD process the desired growth reactions should be much more rapid than the undesired - and possibly uncontrolled - non- ALD reactions. Thus, during the precursor pulse, dissociative chemisorption and by- product desorption should lead rapidly to saturation, before there can be substantial contribution from competing non- limited reactions (such as CVD). During the purge, the physical process of evacuating reagents and byproducts should be faster than reverse reactions on the surface (e.g., etching). The duration of pulse and purge periods should"

Clearly, this is rarely possible, but fortunately there are short- cuts. Comparing the activation energies of selected key reaction steps may be sufficient to answer specific questions about a process, and this is the approach taken in most of the papers reported below. The common approach for ALD modeling is to use DFT to calculate the pathways for precursor adsorption, ligand migration and by- product formation on the surface, yielding reaction energies and activation energies for each step and indicating whether the reaction is thermodynamically or kinetically favorable at the temperature of interest (if the effect of entropy is included). Surfaces may be modeled using either periodic slabs or finite clusters. Empirical corrections of the van der Waals interactions are included in some studies,[9- 11] which is discussed further in section 6.2."

Several reaction mechanisms of alumina ALD are proposed that are consistent with experiment[12- 14] but without specific evidence for surface intermediates and fragments. Exploring the reaction mechanisms at the atomic scale should help us to understand how thin films are deposited with precise thickness control even in high aspect ratio structures.

In general, the acidity/basicity of the surface is seen to depend on the coverage of fragments, and this ultimately explains the self- limiting nature of the ALD reactions. This important step forward in understanding ALD chemistry is only possible through time- consuming calculations that explicitly include a model of the environment around the reactive site."

The presence of a remaining fragment (pink atoms) in the neighborhood of the ligand creates a highly facilitative environment for proton transfer from the surface oxygen to the ligand. The pink fragment does not participate directly in proton transfer but does increase the coordination number of the central surface oxygen. The activation energy computed for proton transfer is thus lower when the pink fragment is present (pink text, eV) than when it is absent (black text, eV). a) "

We may soon be in a position to see how atomistic growth chemistry dictates properties at higher scales, such as film morphology. These insights should help advance our understanding of the ALD of other oxides (section 2.2) and help design novel ALD processes."

The precursor first undergoes dissociative chemisorption on the surface, leaving a Si atom attached to the surface and releasing by- products into the gas phase. Here there is a significant difference to the ALD of metal oxides and nitrides: an energetic barrier towards the breaking of Si- ligand bonds must usually be overcome before Si can form a new bond to the surface and chemisorb (Figure 3). Ligands may be simultaneously protonated to form by- products. After purging out the Si precursor, the appropriate co- reagent is pulsed into the reactor. "

Deposition of metal from metalorganic precursors generally requires electron transfer to the metal, which means that redox reactions must take place. Our existing knowledge about the Lewis and Bronsted acid- base reactions that drive the ALD of oxides and nitrides is not therefore particularly useful. Some metal ALD processes use plasma, which further complicates the mechanism. This lack of mechanistic understanding, of course, hinders the application of the ALD technique to metals. Ideally, computational studies would propose new metal ALD precursors and processes by showing what is needed for the key goals of facile but self- limiting growth reactions at low temperature on a given substrate, along with suppression of competing side- reactions and impurities. In actuality of course, close collaboration between theory and experiment is needed to achieve a useful level of understanding."

Of these desirable properties, thermodynamic reactivity with the co- reagent and surface may be accurately calculated with DFT, and this can allow the screening of candidate precursors before synthesis. Following this rationale, Orimoto et al. compute the stability of a series of copper(II)diketonate complexes.[82] Likewise, two novel N- heterocyclic carbene containing copper(I) amides are reported as precursors for copper ALD, and DFT is used to assess the strength of the carbene- copper bond, the charge distribution after dissociation and the adsorption on copper surfaces.[83] A copper(I) carbene hydride complex acting both as reducing agent and precursor for Cu ALD is proposed based on DFT calculations.[84] Like hydride, formate can be a source of electrons in metal ALD, as revealed in our calculations on the three- step ALD process published by Knisley et al. involving the reaction of "

Many open questions have yet to be addressed, such as modeling the evolution of grains versus films and how this depends on substrate preparation and gas exposure. There are no studies to date at the atomistic level of how multiple layers of metal may be oxidized and reduced in every cycle of noble metal ALD, as predicted by fitting to experiment.[93] Multi- scale modeling techniques may be useful here (section 6.4), but only if sufficient atomic- scale information becomes available on which to base the higher- scale simulations."

There are a number of reasons for this. As discussed in the other sections of this article, ALD is modeled with reasonable success as multi- step chemical reactions of a precursor with a two- dimensional solid surface to give a material with a known crystal structure. MLD on the other hand involves larger precursor molecules, interacting both weakly and strongly with a three- dimensional and partially molten surface zone of a polymer of unknown secondary and tertiary structure. Many of these aspects are particularly problematical for DFT, including large simulation cells, weak interactions, long- time MD and unknown substrate structure. Molecular mechanics models may be better suited to tackling these issues, but may not be reliable for chemical reactions, especially where metal cations are involved. Because of this, the mechanism of MLD is generally even less well understood than that of inorganic ALD. Here, we summarize the few modeling studies of MLD processes to date."

Adequate volatility is thus a vital property for a successful ALD precursor and must be established before a precursor can be considered for testing in an ALD reactor. Theoretical screening of precursor volatility would therefore make the development of new ALD chemistries much more efficient."

Theoretical analysis is thus based on determining equilibrium concentrations between gas and condensed phase for the transition between these phases at some temperature. Phase transitions are collective macroscopic phenomena that occur over time and length scales that are not directly accessible through microscopic simulations of aggregates of molecules, such as by explicit MD or constant- volume Monte Carlo simulations. However, statistical mechanics can provide a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic views. For phase transitions, an appropriate approach is to use the Gibbs Ensemble "

This in turn leads to strong interactions: covalent Cu- Cu bonding, electron transfer to adsorbate Cu, lengthening of Cu- ligand bonds and substantial distortion of the chemisorbed complex. By triggering this transition from physisorption to chemisorption, inclusion of the vdW adjustment can cause an increase in the adsorption energy by over "

It is hoped that a deeper understanding of these interactions at the atomic scale can be obtained through simulations, not only addressing mechanistic issues but also providing information for equipment development and industrial scale- up. The complexity of the mechanisms makes them very challenging to simulate, considering both the variety of active species in the plasma (electrons, radicals and ions in ground and excited states) and the numerous parallel reaction pathways open to them."

Much has already been reported for modeling plasma catalysis using MD and DFT, focusing on specific effects of a catalyst on a plasma and vice versa.[113] However no studies are reported at this level for plasma ALD surface reactions. Tentative steps are taken to model radicals in oxygen plasma or ozone as atomic and/or molecular species in various spin states and their reactions during ALD of alumina[28] and hafnia.[114] A major difficulty is the reliability of DFT in quantifying the redox (or combustion) reactions of radicals generated in the plasma, as radicals may change spins on the surface, resulting in the crossing of potential energy hypersurfaces. More accurate multi- configurational ab initio approaches for spin crossings are at this time prohibitively time- consuming on systems of this size."

The pulsed flow of gases into meter- scale reactors, around millimeter- scaled geometries, leads to chemical reactions between atoms, which aggregate into nanometer- thick films and coat micrometer- scaled pores or particles. It is clearly impossible to describe explicitly all of these length scales in one model, and most simulations are 'multi- scale' insofar as they involve coupling between selected length scales according to the property of interest. A successful multi- scale model minimizes the propagation of errors from one scale to the next. The problem of timescale in ALD is perhaps even more acute than that of length scale, since a combination of fast (ps- ns) and slow reactions (us- ms) contribute to film growth, and the pressure "

In KMC, film growth is modeled by the sequential execution of elementary reaction steps at certain locations, stochastically selected according to their relative kinetics. Time is coarse- grained, proceeding in irregular jumps from one reaction event to the next.[115] The timescales of seconds needed for ALD pulses and purges can therefore be simulated if the events are sufficiently rare. There is loose coupling with the atomic scale, as this is the source of the reaction events and their probabilities (i.e., activation energies). The most common implementation is Lattice KMC, where events take place on a fixed lattice of cells in space, and a group of atoms is associated with each cell. The bulk crystallographic lattice of the product film is often chosen as the simulation lattice and including a few thousand such cells means that areas of the order of "

The most significant contribution from such modeling is probably in developing our understanding of ALD chemistry: challenging proposed mechanisms or providing evidence to support them, and often yielding unexpected new ideas that can help move the field forward. DFT continues to be the method of choice, as a reliable, accurate, parameter- free approach to computing electronic structure and hence chemical structure and bonding, leading eventually to thermodynamics and kinetics. Increases in computational power allow ever larger model systems to be simulated, or a wider variety of models. As the work outlined above illustrates, it is now commonplace not only to simulate the pathway of interest, but to strengthen the argument by checking competing pathways as well. Large cells allow more complex arrangements of multiple adsorbates to be simulated, giving a superior model of the saturated surface during ALD. Nevertheless, the choice of model remains the main source of uncertainty and error in DFT- level calculations."

Each sticking event involves multiple chemical reactions that can generally be described as dissociative chemisorption of the precursor, along with associative desorption of by- products, leaving the involatile target material bound to the surface. For ALD of oxides and nitrides (sections 2 and 3), these are predominantly the acid- base reactions of adduct formation and H- transfer (sometimes described as 'ligand exchange' even where ligands do not swap places). But for metals (section 4), plasmas (section 6.3) and ligand decomposition reactions, it is becoming increasingly important to develop an understanding of redox reactions at surfaces."

This yields information about bond strengths and thermodynamics that can give qualitative insights into the reaction mechanism, but no information on structure. \n(b) Bringing a single precursor molecule close to a model 2D surface (cluster or slab) allows computation of the structure and energetics of the chemisorption reaction steps, thus quantifying the ALD mechanism. The bonds thus formed are the basis of the primary structure of the target material. \n(c) Recent work shows that higher accuracy data about reaction pathways can be obtained with larger and more realistic models of the local environment around a reaction site, featuring multiple precursor fragments interacting with a zone of multiple surface layers.[2] More work at this scale may reveal structural motifs that lead to particular crystal"
