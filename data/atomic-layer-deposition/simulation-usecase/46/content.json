The adsorption energy increased with the number of the  $- N(CH_3)_2$  ligands, while the reaction energy barrier showed a parabolic behavior.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) that is based on sequential and self- limiting surface reaction is the most suitable deposition technique to meet the requirement of the atomic- scale filmthickness accuracy [1]. During the initial ALD stage, the precursors are adsorbed on the surface, react with it via bond breakings and makings, and form reaction products. In order to become a suitable ALD precursor, the adsorption energy of the precursor on the surface should be higher than the reaction energy barrier between the precursor and the surface; otherwise, the precursor would desorb rather than react with the surface [2].",

Among many silicon (Si) precursors, those that consist of dimethylamino (DMA,  $- N(CH_3)_2)$  ligands were attractive because the number of DMA ligands affected the reaction between the Si precursors and the surface [3,4].

All calculations considered the van der Waals interaction based on Grimme's DFT- D2 approach [13]. The effect of temperature on the adsorption energy was considered by using the Joint Army- Navy- Air Force (JANAF) Thermochemical Tables [14].

The cutoff energy of  $500\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $2\\times 2\\times 1k$  - points mesh with zero shift for a slab structure including a 2- nm thick vacuum layer were used to generate the plane wave basis set with the Monkhorst- Pack grid method [15].

The Bader analysis method was performed to calculate the electronic charge density of atoms [19,20]. The optimized Si precursors were adsorbed on the surface with consideration of the weak bond breakage during the following chemical reaction, and their reaction energy barrier calculation was performed using the climbing nudged elastic band (CI- NEB) tool implemented in the VASP code [21]. Six images including the initial and final configurations were used for the CI- NEB calculations.

Various configurations for DMAS, BDMAS, TDMAS, and TeDMAS adsorption on the surface were also tried, and their optimized adsorption configurations are shown in Fig. 2. The optimized DMAS adsorption configuration resulted in an adsorption energy of  $0.59\\mathrm{eV}$  when the  $\\mathrm{Si}_{\\mathrm{DMAS}}$  and  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{DMAS}}$  atoms were located on the  $\\mathrm{O - OH}$  and  $\\mathrm{H - OH}$  atoms at  $\\mathrm{Si}_{\\mathrm{DMAS}}\\dots \\mathrm{O - OH}$  and  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{DMAS}}\\dots \\mathrm{H - OH}$  distances of 3.03 and  $1.74\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , respectively. The DMAS adsorption energy was higher than that of silane due to the negative Bader charge of the N atom being stronger than that of the H atom. Since BDMAS has two DMA ligands, two optimized adsorption configurations were plausible. The first adsorption configuration (BDMAS1Si81N) followed the trend of the DMAS adsorption; one N atom of the DMA ligand is attracted to the  $\\mathrm{H - OH}$  atom. At this BDMAS adsorption configuration, the  $\\mathrm{Si}_{\\mathrm{BDMS}}\\dots \\mathrm{O - OH}$  and  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BDMS}}\\dots \\mathrm{H - OH}$  distances were 3.12 and  $1.69\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , respectively, with an adsorption energy of  $0.66\\mathrm{eV}$ . Additionally, due to the two  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BDMS}}$  atoms, the other optimized BDMAS adsorption configuration (BDMAS2N) was obtained when the two  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BDMS}}$  atoms were located on the two  $\\mathrm{H - OH}$  atoms at  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BDMS}}\\dots \\mathrm{H - OH}$  distances of 1.83 and  $1.84\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . Though higher adsorption energy was expected due to the two  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BDMS}}\\dots \\mathrm{H - OH}$  attractions, the BDMAS2N adsorption energy was  $0.69\\mathrm{eV}$ , which was similar to that of BDMAS1Si81N. This can be explained by the  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{BDMS}}\\dots \\mathrm{H - OH}$  distance of BDMAS2N that is longer than that of BDMAS1Si81N. The optimized TDMAS and TeDMAS adsorption configurations also followed the trend of the DMAS adsorption. At its TDMAS (TeDMAS) adsorption configuration, the  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{DMAS}}$  (TeDMAS) $\\dots \\mathrm{O - OH}$  and  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{DMAS}}$  (TeDMAS) $\\dots \\mathrm{H - OH}$  distances were 3.20 (3.44) and 1.77 (1.75)  $\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , respectively, with an adsorption energy of  $0.74$  (0.84)  $\\mathrm{eV}$ ; the numbers in parentheses refer to values for the TeDMAS adsorption. However, when TDMAS and TeDMAS were adsorbed with two DMA ligands close to the surface, its adsorption energy decreased by more than  $0.28\\mathrm{eV}$  in comparison with that of the optimized adsorption configurations due to the steric hindrance between the bulky DMA ligands and the surface. Table 3 shows the variation of the bond dissociation energies and the bond lengths at the adsorption configurations. When silane was adsorbed on the surface, the bond dissociation energies decreased a little with no change of the bond lengths. DMAS, BDMAS, TDMAS, and TeDMAS precursors showed a decrease in bond dissociation energies and an increase in bond lengths. Unlike the Si precursors containing the DMA ligand(s), silane exhibited a slight decrease of the bond dissociation energies and no change of the bond lengths. This can be explained by the lower attraction between the  $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{silane}}$  and  $\\mathrm{H - OH}$  atoms than that between the  $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{precursor}}$  and  $\\mathrm{H - OH}$  atoms.",

Based on the adsorption energies with the consideration of the effect of temperature, all Si precursors would not react on the surface because the reaction energy barrier is higher than the adsorption energy. We know that BDMAS and TDMAS are experimentally suitable Si precursors while silane and TeDMAS are not for  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  ALD [3,4]. From these experimental results, an acceptable range for the curve of the adsorption energy is found, as shown in Fig. 4, to be in agreement with the experimental results. Based on the acceptable range for the curve of the adsorption energy, the adsorption energy of DMAS would be higher than the reaction energy barrier; this indicates that DMAS would be a good Si precursor for  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  ALD.",

        "text": "The reaction energy barrier decreased from 1.42 to  $0.28\\mathrm{eV}$  when the number of DMA ligands increased from zero to two (Fig. 4). This behavior was acceptable due to the increase of the adsorption energy with the number of DMA ligands and the decrease of the bond dissociation energy. However, when the number of DMA ligands became more than two, the reaction energy barrier started to increase. In order to consider the effect of strain energy on the reaction energy barrier, the variation of the bond lengths on the surface and the Si precursors at the transition configuration was calculated, as shown in Fig. 5.  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - Si}}$  indicates the sum of the variation of the Si- Si bond lengths near to the reaction site on the surface, and  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - L}}$  indicates the sum of the variation of the Si- ligand bond lengths in the Si precursors.  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - Si}}$  did not change when the number of DMA ligands increased from zero to one; the Si precursor is changed from silane to DMAS. Replacement of two DMA ligands for BDMAS showed two different values of  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - Si}}$  The  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - Si}}$  of BDMAS1Si&1N was higher, while that of BDMAS2N was lower than that of DMAs.  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - Si}}$  increased when the number of DMA ligands became more than two.  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - L}}$  did not change when the number of DMA ligands increased from zero to three. However, when the number of DMA ligands increased from three to four,  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - L}}$  increased significantly. Therefore, the increase of the reaction energy barrier with the number of DMA ligands can be attributed to the strain energy increase by the increase of  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - Si}}$  and  $\\sum d_{\\mathrm{Si - L}}$",

The adsorption energy of the Si precursors on the surface increased significantly when the number of DMA ligands increased from zero to one. This is mainly due to one N atom of the DMA ligand. The reaction energy barrier of the Si precursors with the surface showed a parabolic behavior. The decrease of the reaction energy barrier could be explained by the increase of the adsorption energy and the decrease of the bond dissociation energy when the number of DMA ligands is less than two. The increase of the reaction energy barrier with replacement of more than two DMA ligands was explained through the increase of the strain energy estimated by the greater variation of the bond lengths. From these calculations, we would recommend DMAS as a suitable precursor in addition to the experimentally proven BDMAS and TDMAS among the five tested Si precursors.",
