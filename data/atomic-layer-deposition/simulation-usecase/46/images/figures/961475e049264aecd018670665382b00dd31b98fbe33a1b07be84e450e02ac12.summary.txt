The line chart illustrates the relationship between the number of dimethylamino ligands and the sum of Si-Si distances (Ã…) for two different molecular structures, BDMAS<sup>2N</sup> and BDMAS<sup>1Si&1N</sup>. Both structures show a linear increase in the sum of Si-Si distances as the number of dimethylamino ligands increases.
