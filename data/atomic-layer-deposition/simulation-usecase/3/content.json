        "text": "Alumina thin film is typically studied as a model atomic layer deposition (ALD) process due to its high dielectric constant, high thermal stability, and good adhesion on various wafer surfaces. Despite extensive applications of alumina ALD in microelectronics industries, details on the physical and chemical processes are not yet well understood. ALD experiments are not able to shed adequate light on the detailed information regarding the transient ALD process. Most of current numerical approaches lack detailed surface reaction mechanisms, and their results are not well correlated with experimental observations. In this paper, the authors present a combined experimental and numerical study on the details of flow and surface reactions in alumina ALD using trimethylaluminum and water as precursors. Results obtained from experiments and simulations are compared and correlated. By experiments, growth rate on five samples under different deposition conditions is characterized. The deposition rate from numerical simulation agrees well with the experimental results. Details of precursor distributions in a full cycle of ALD are studied numerically to bridge between experimental observations and simulations. The 3D transient numerical model adopts surface reaction kinetics and mechanisms based on atomic- level studies to investigate the surface deposition process. Surface deposition is shown as a strictly self- limited process in our numerical studies. ALD is a complex strong- coupled fluid, thermal and chemical process, which is not only heavily dependent on the chemical kinetics and surface conditions but also on the flow and material distributions. © 2015 American Vacuum Society.

In  $8\\mathrm{s}$  purging time, growth rate of outlet sample is  $\\sim 0.10\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle lower than the inlet sample. The lower deposition rate on sample C is possibly attributed to the following facts: (1) The outlet sample C is close to the vacuum pump, and the flow at outlet is much faster than at inlets. The convective effect on precursor transport is much stronger at outlet, and consequently, weaker diffusive effect decreases the deposition rate; (2) For the sample C, although all the precursor molecules gather at outlet, most precursor molecules are consumed in the surface reactions on the wafers and also the system inner surfaces. In fact, the amount of precursor molecules reaching at outlet would be much smaller than the inlet area. Furthermore, precursors are diluted by the resultant gas product  $\\mathrm{CH}_4$ , and hence, its concentration is largely decreased at the outlet.

Before surface species get saturated, deposition rate is increasing with precursor concentration and the rate is largely restrained once the surface sites are fully taken by nonreactive surface species. Surface reactions are strictly self- terminated after reactive surface species are totally substituted, even though precursor concentration is still being increased. This is the self- limiting nature of ALD operations, which ensures the uniformity and accurate thickness controllability of deposited films.",
