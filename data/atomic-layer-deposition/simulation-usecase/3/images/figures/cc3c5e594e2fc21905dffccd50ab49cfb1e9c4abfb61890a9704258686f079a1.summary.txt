The chart illustrates the growth per cycle (Å/Cycle) at different temperatures (°C) for three methods: experimental with 8 seconds purging, experimental with 20 seconds purging, and numerical simulation. The numerical simulation shows the highest growth values across all temperatures, followed by the experimental method with 20 seconds of purging, and then the experimental method with 8 seconds of purging.
