The chart illustrates the effects of temperature on the surface deposition rate of aluminum, OH surface coverage, and H₂O mole fraction during a water pulse. As temperature increases from 100°C to 250°C, the surface deposition rate decreases, while OH surface coverage and H₂O mole fraction increase.
