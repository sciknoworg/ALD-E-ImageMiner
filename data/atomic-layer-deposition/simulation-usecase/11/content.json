We have applied this model to two standard types of cross- flow reactors: a cylindrical tube reactor and a model  $300\\mathrm{mm}$  wafer reactor, and explored both ideal and nonideal self- limited kinetics. The model results are in agreement with experimental results and analytic expressions obtained using a simple plug- flow model for the cylindrical tube reactor. We also extended the simulations to consider two nonideal self- limited processes: soft- saturating processes characterized by a slow reaction pathway and processes where surface by- products can compete with the precursor for the same pool of adsorption sites. Our results show that it is possible to have a self- limited process with saturated yet inhomogeneous growth profiles due to the competition of reactor by- products. This is in agreement with experimental observations for titanium dioxide ALD from titanium tetraisopropoxide and titanium tetrachloride precursors.",

Consequently, the contribution of the reactant transport of species inside the reactor needs to be considered when extracting information on the surface kinetics from in situ measurements. The transport of species is also key to understanding the scale- up of a process and optimizing reactor geometry.",

(2) how does reactive transport impact the data obtained using in situ measurement tools such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), and (3) what is the impact that nonidealities in the surface kinetics have on the saturation profiles and homogeneity at the reactor scale?

This is also an issue for the mass diffusivity of different precursor molecules. Except for a few of the most commonly used precursors and some recent studies,17,27 the diffusivity of the majority of relevant species for ALD and ALE is not known. One way of extracting information on surface kinetics is through the use of saturation profiles. As mentioned above, plug- flow approximations have been used in the past to model and extract kinetic data from saturation profiles at a reactor scale. Likewise, growth profiles inside high aspect ratio features can be used to extract effective sticking probabilities of selflimited processes. Recently, the use of macrotrenches has greatly simplified the characterization of these growth profiles, allowing the use of techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry.22 The comparison between the kinetics at a reactor scale and inside macrotrenches can also provide information on the impact of the surface fluxes of different species on the kinetics of self- limited processes.",

Using kinetic data for trimethylaluminum previously extracted in our tube reactor and fitted to the plug- flow model, we simulated this process using the model described in this work. The results, shown in Fig. 16(b), are obtained after considering three full ALD cycles. Without any fitting parameter, the agreement between the simulation and experiments is remarkably good, even capturing the presence of a nonself- limited CVD component at the center of the oval due to the simultaneous presence of trimethylaluminum and water on the surface. The main discrepancy between the simulations and the experiments is near the injection point: our model considers well- separated pulses, while in reality, the long injection channels cause a spread of the trimethylaluminum and water pulses, leading to a higher growth rate near the injectors due to precursor mixing.
