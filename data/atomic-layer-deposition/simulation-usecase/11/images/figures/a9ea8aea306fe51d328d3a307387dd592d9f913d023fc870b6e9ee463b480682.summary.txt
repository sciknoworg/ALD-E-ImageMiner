The chart illustrates the average coverage and 3σ variability over time for two scenarios: 'Ideal' and 'f2 = 0.1'. Both scenarios show that the average coverage approaches 1.0 as time increases, while the 3σ variability decreases significantly, stabilizing around 0.0 for the 'Ideal' scenario and remaining above 1.0 for 'f2 = 0.1'.
