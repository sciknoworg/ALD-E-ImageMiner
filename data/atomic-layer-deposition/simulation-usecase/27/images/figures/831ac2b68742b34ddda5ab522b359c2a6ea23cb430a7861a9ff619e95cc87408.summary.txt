The flowchart illustrates a process for simulating the relaxation of a surface with hydroxyl (-OH) groups using Monte Carlo (MC) moves and simulated annealing. It starts by scanning the surface for -OH groups, then randomly selects one to attempt a move. If successful, it calculates the energy change (Î”Er) and checks for acceptance. If the system is not a monolayer, simulated annealing is applied.
