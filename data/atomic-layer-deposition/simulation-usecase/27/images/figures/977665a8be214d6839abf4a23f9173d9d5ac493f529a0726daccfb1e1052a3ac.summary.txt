The flowchart illustrates a process where functional groups are initially present on a surface. Precursor molecules attach to these groups, followed by an inner gas purge to remove excess precursor. This is then followed by a plasma treatment that modifies the surface properties. The process can be repeated by repeating the inner gas purge and plasma treatment cycle.
