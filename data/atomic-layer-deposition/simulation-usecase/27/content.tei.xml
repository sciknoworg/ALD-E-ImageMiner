<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is a widely used, powerful layer-by-layer coating technology. Here, we present an atomistic simulation scheme for PEALD processes, combining the Monte Carlo deposition algorithm and structure relaxation using molecular dynamics. In contrast to previous implementations, our approach employs a real, atomistic model of the precursor. This allows us to account for steric hindrance and overlap restrictions at the surface corresponding to the real precursor deposition step. In addition, our scheme takes various process parameters into account, employing predefined probabilities for precursor products at each Monte Carlo deposition step. The new simulation protocol was applied to investigate PEALD synthesis of SiO 2 thin films using the bis-diethylaminosilane precursor. It revealed that increasing the probability for precursor binding to one surface oxygen atom favors amorphous layer growth, a large number of -OH impurities, and the formation of voids. In contrast, a higher probability for precursor binding to two surface oxygen atoms leads to dense SiO 2 film growth and a reduction of -OH impurities. Increasing the probability for the formation of doubly bonded precursor sites is therefore the key factor for the formation of dense SiO 2 PEALD thin films with reduced amounts of voids and -OH impurities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a coating technology based on self-terminating reactions of gaseous precursor molecules with surface functional groups of the substrate. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, a precursor vapor (usually an organometallic compound) is introduced in the chemical reactor. It reacts with the functional groups at the surface of the substrate, until the surface is saturated (first half-cycle). Excess precursor and reaction byproducts are purged by inert gases. Next, a second precursor is pulsed in the reactor, such as an oxidizing agent like H 2 O, ozone, O 2 , or O 2 plasma, which reacts with the remaining ligands of the precursor material (second half-cycle). The reactor is purged again. The ALD process is continued by repeating the above pulsing and purging steps, which constitute the ALD cycle, until the desired film thickness is reached. These reactions depend only on the abundancy and variety of the surface functional groups for a specific precursor, and not on the shape of the substrate. Hence, the ALD technology leads to extremely conformal coatings on highly curved <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or nanostructured substrates. Additionally, the composition of the thin films can be controlled with atomic precision by alternating the organometallic compound for binary or more complex mixtures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD), which utilizes oxygen plasma, is applied in order to increase the reactivity of the oxidizing agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This enables, for example, room temperature deposition of SiO 2 thin films, which is possible only at 200 • C in typical thermal processes using O 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, recently developed highly reactive precursors allow for thermal ALD processes at temperatures approaching room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The O radical species present in the plasma allow for additional tailoring of material properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. For example, in the case of TiO 2 coatings, PEALD films are denser and have a higher refractive index <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Atomistic simulations of PEALD processes are of particular interest for the fundamental understanding of the growth processes, mechanisms of material densification and crystallization, void formation, intermixing, and mechanical properties of the coatings at an atomic level <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, such simulations are very challenging due to the usually significant number of competing chemical reactions and the thickness-dependent structure relaxation of the growing surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For mechanistic questions, such as reaction paths, reaction energies and barriers electronic structure approaches are the methods of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In particular, the advent of modern density functional theory (DFT) based on accurate gradient-corrected and hybrid functionals allowed for the identification and understanding of elementary chemical reactions of a number of ALD processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For example, the understanding of SiO 2 ALD mechanisms has proceeded through a number of computational studies employing DFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The reactivities have been investigated for a number of aminosilane precursors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which display low activation energies for reactions with surface hydroxyl groups. Despite the progress in the applications and development of electronic structure methods, their computational cost is still too high to reliably simulate the overall ALD growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. This task can only be achieved by employing more approximate methods capable of extending the spatiotemporal scale accessible for simulations. The two such approaches applied for studies of ALD growth dynamics are the atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model and molecular dynamics (MD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>KMC is a stochastic method intended to simulate the time evolution of processes that occur with priori known transition rates among states. The main advantage of the KMC method is its ability to model a broad range of time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, it relies on an accurate knowledge of rate constants for all elementary reaction steps. Such information is difficult to obtain by employing DFT due to the deficiencies of existing exchange-correlation functionals and requires more accurate and computationally much more demanding electronic structure methods. Another disadvantage of the KMC approach is its inability to simulate the morphology of the growing ALD film, i.e., crystalline vs. amorphous growth. Atomistic KMC simulations using DFT-derived reaction mechanisms and activation energies have been used, e.g., to investigate ALD growth of HfO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>In MD simulations, the time evolution of interacting atoms is described directly by solutions of the corresponding equations of motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Therefore, the MD method, in combination with carefully parameterized potential functions or reactive force fields, is able to describe relaxation phenomena and defects in ALD-generated films. However, the temporal scale of MD simulations (ps to ns) is very small compared to the duration of ALD pulses. This problem has been addressed by Hu et al. in MD simulations of Al 2 O 3 ALD by separating the large time scale of surface reactions (ns to s) from the small time scale of structural relaxation (ps) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Their deposition algorithm assumes that ALD reactions occur only on the active -OH groups on the growing surface and that the products of the metal precursor pulses can be fully hydroxylated, i.e., -Al(CH 3 ) 2 is fully converted to -Al(OH) 2 . The direct (large time scale) simulations of surface reactions are replaced by a deposition algorithm. This starts with a hydroxylated surface and randomly picks one of the available surface -OH groups for the deposition of the ALD product (-Al(OH) 2 ). Approximate steric and overlap restrictions with neighboring atoms are checked and, if satisfied, an H atom in the selected -OH group is replaced by -Al(OH) 2 . After each deposition step, the structure is relaxed using MD simulation. Unlike KMC, this MD-based approach enables us to study the thickness-dependent evolution of the microscopic structures of ALD layers. In addition, the influences of operating parameters, such as precursor type, temperature, external fields, initial surface structure (crystalline vs. amorphous), number and distribution of -OH, etc. on the ALD process can be investigated at the atomic level.</p><p>Due to a high computational cost, MD simulations of large systems are rarely performed using electronic structure methods. Instead, more approximate approaches, such as interatomic potential functions or force fields, are used. However, the applicability of many interatomic potentials is restricted to one element oxidation state and a small number of polymorphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A relatively new and promising trend in the development of simulation methods for nanomaterials is the use of so-called reactive force fields, such as the ReaxFF approach of van Duin and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This has been applied to a wide range of materials including amorphous and crystalline SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and Al 2 O 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, yielding very good agreement with experimental data. Although parameterization of ReaxFF is relatively complex, it is very powerful since it allows for an accurate description of the chemistry of nanostructures with a computational cost far below that of quantum mechanical methods. In our recent study, we demonstrated that the structure of amorphous SiO 2 could be accurately described at the ReaxFF level by employing relatively small semi-amorphous periodic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. A simulation cell containing only 64 SiO 2 units yielded a structure that properly reproduced experimental structural parameters, mechanical properties, and IR spectra of bulk silica, using subsequent refinement at the DFT level.</p><p>In this article, we present an atomistic simulation scheme for a PEALD process that combines the Monte Carlo (MC) deposition algorithm and structure relaxation using MD.

However, in contrast to their implementation that directly deposits hydroxylated products of the second ALD half-cycle, we use a real, atomistic model of the precursor deposited in the first half-cycle. In addition, for the MC deposition step, our approach introduces site occupation probabilities for precursor reaction products.

The aim of the cluster studies was to obtain insights into the intrinsic energetics of the reactions without the spatial and steric constraints present at silica surfaces. All three reactions (1, 2a, and 2b) of the precursor with the cluster model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a</ref> are exothermic, with reaction energies ∆𝐸 r of -58.3, -64.3, -6.0 kJ/mol, respectively. Reaction 3, converting S1 to S2, is slightly endothermic, with an ∆𝐸 r of 37.5 kJ/mol. For the bigger cluster model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b</ref>, the calculated reaction energies ∆𝐸 r of reactions 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 are -67.0, -30.5, +36.5, and +63.0 kJ/mol, respectively.

Reaction energies for reaction 2a increase with increasing rigidity of the structure, while remaining exothermic. In contrast, reaction 2b is slightly exothermic for the small, flexible cluster model, but becomes endothermic for the structurally rigid models of the bigger cluster and surface. Reaction 3 is endothermic for all models, but reaction energies increase with increasing rigidity of the structure. Thus, reactions 1 and 2a are always energetically favorable. In contrast, reactions 2b and 3, transforming P1 to P2 and S1 to S2, respectively, are energetically unfavorable in a rigid atomic environment. This can be attributed to constraints of the surface on the one hand, since bringing two surface oxygen atoms close enough to create sites P2 and S2 is connected with energy penalty.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">PEALD Simulations</head><p>The cluster and periodic calculations demonstrate that the actual amount of precursor deposition products P1 and P2 as well as the plasma products S1 and S2 formed at each PEALD cycle will be influenced by the actual surface structure and the availability of neighboring -OH groups. In addition, temperature, pressure, and concentration of precursor species, and plasma energy are expected to play an important role. Accurate simulations including all these parameters would be a very complex task. As described earlier, our scheme takes the process parameters into account in a simplified way, employing predefined occupation probabilities at each deposition MC step. The probabilities for the creation of P1 (precursor bonded to one surface O atom) and P2 (precursor bonded to two surface O atoms) are p P1 and p P2 = 1p P1 , respectively. The value p P2 = 1 means that each Monte Carlo step attempts to create P2, and P1 is created only if P2 cannot be formed due to missing neighboring surface -OH groups or steric constraints. In contrast, p P2 = 0 means that no P2 is directly created during MC moves. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref>, these probabilities have significant impacts on the structures of PEALD layers. The simulated structures of SiO 2 deposited for probabilities p P2 = 0 (p P1 = 1), p P2 = 0.5 (p P1 = 0.5), and p P2 = 1 (p P1 = 0) clearly demonstrate the densification of the growing SiO 2 layer with increasing p P2 . For p P2 = 0, each precursor molecule is allowed to react with only one surface -OH group, yielding P1. The plasma pulse converts P1 to S1, with three hydroxyl groups connected to the deposited silicon atom. This increases the number of hydroxyl groups compared to the initial state, thus favoring the creation of voids, -OH impurities, and amorphous growth of deposited films. In contrast, for p P2 = 1, after the first ALD half-cycle, the maximum possible number of P2 precursor sites is created. The plasma pulse converts P2 to S2, with two hydroxyl groups connected to the deposited silicon atom. In this case, the number of hydroxyl groups remains unchanged after the deposition step compared to the initial surface state, and, in combination with compact Si-O-Si bridges, it results in a dense film growth. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6</ref> shows the average growth per cycle (GPC) and mass densities of deposited SiO 2 thin films obtained by 30 simulations of seven PEALD cycles for each of p P2 = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0. Virtually identical results were obtained for MD simulations at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 K at a time scale of up to 10 ps. GPC and mass densities were basically converged after seven simulated PEALD cycles. Decreasing GPC and increasing density were observed for increasing p P2 , confirming the observed densification of thin films shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref>. The very low values for GPC and density in the case of p P2 = 0 are mainly due to the strong steric effects when only creation of singly coordinated P1 and S1 is allowed and creation of P2 and S2 is completely excluded.

The actual reaction conditions were accounted for only in an approximate way in our occupation probability model. For instance, possible precursor desorption due to the substrate heating was not directly simulated. Possible influences from precursor temperature and concentration were not directly simulated, since our MC scheme deposits one precursor molecule after the other, disregarding the actual reaction path. However, we expect that our model can describe plasma energy effects, since the presence of plasma ions in the second half-cycle may affect reactions 2b and 3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref>), and therefore the occupation probabilities of doubly coordinated products P2 and S2.</p><p>Our simulation scheme has been tested for BDEAS as a bis-aminosilane precursor containing two amino ligands.

Aminosilane precursors with three or four amino ligands can lead, in principle, to even higher surface densification, since they can increase the number of compact Si-O-Si bridges. However, the higher number of amino ligands favors steric hindrance effects, and triply and quadruply occupied surface sites strongly reduce the availability of surface -OH groups, thus inhibiting the overall film growth.
