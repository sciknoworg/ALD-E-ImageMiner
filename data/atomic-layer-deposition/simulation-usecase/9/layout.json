Density functional theory within the hybrid functional is used to determine the detailed physicochemical mechanisms and associated energetics of the two half cycles taking place during the initial stage of film growth. A kinetic Monte Carlo model is then proposed that deals with the stochastic nature of the calculated DFT mechanisms and barriers. Beyond the chemical information emanating from DFT calculations, the lattice- based KMC approach requires preliminary physical considerations issued from the crystal structures that the system is intended to adopt. This is especially critical in the case of heterogeneous systems like oxides deposited on silicon. We also describe (i) how atomistic configuration changes are performed as a result of local events consisting in elementary reaction mechanisms occurring on specific lattice sites, (ii) the temporal dynamics, governed by transition probabilities, calculated for every event from DFT activation barriers, and (iii) the relation of KMC with the ALD experimental procedure. Some preliminary validation results of the whole multiscale strategy are given for illustration and pertinence with regard of the technological main issues."

In recent studies, some groups have investigated specific problems of ALD of hafnia films, their structural, optical, and electrical characteristics.25- 28 They show that diffusion and solid- state reactions at the substrate- film interface may influence the film material and create or modify an interface layer between the film and substrate.29 On silicon substrates, these reactions could result in undesirable formation of defects, silicate or silicide layers, which may further significantly deteriorate the properties of the dielectric layer.29- 32 Others issues, such as contamination effects resulting from the uncontrolled precursor decomposition, are observed.

For these reasons, a detailed understanding of the basic mechanisms that take place during each cycle of ALD has been the subject of intensive research effort by several theoretical groups using first principles, especially via density functional theory.35- 51 In our group, we have considered the ab initio study of the initial stage of the ALD as being essential for the complete understanding and the control of the growth of the high- "

Rigorously, molecular dynamics should be a suitable tool to address atomic scale process simulation. However, microelectronic processes deal with mesoscopic structures, several millions of atoms, and cover timescales beyond seconds or minutes. Molecular dynamics is then limited for two major reasons: (i) interatomic potentials have to be generated, which is a particularly difficult task in the frame of heterostructures and interfaces, and (ii) timescales are limited to nanoseconds of experimental duration. Thus kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is an alternative procedure that is of great help in the modeling of microelectronic processes: a lattice- based model makes it possible to avoid the detailed description of continuous atomic trajectories, and the kinetics of the sequence of events is explicitly treated and can meet typical process durations. While traditional thermodynamic and kinetic models deal with average physical quantities, kinetic Monte Carlo is able to consider a wide range of possible configurations at the atomic scale and to choose only one random path out of all possible ones. This corresponds to an actual (ALD) experiment. The path is determined according to random numbers sampled according to transition probabilities between configurations. Obviously, the transition probabilities depend also on the local configuration, activation barriers and on the film deposition conditions, such as pressure and temperature. Moreover the role of each mechanistic step on an ensemble of interacting species makes it feasible to uncover process- dependent types of growth, kinetics, and their associated atomic arrangements. The present paper is dedicated to the description of the preliminary version of our KMC tool enabling the treatment of "

KMC is a stochastic- based model aimed at simulation of film growth at the atomic scale, the final objective being to furnish alternative/new tools for replacement of the macroscopic conventional TCAD tools used for years by engineers in microelectronics. Indeed, from the engineering point of view, the main interest is in the microstructure that is produced under specific processing conditions. Such a model performs virtually the explicit experimental processing procedure event after event, at the atomic scale. This is operated through probabilistic rules that make the overall simulation comparable with an actual experiment.61,62 It involves millions of atoms with a time duration longer than the second. Unfortunately, the most predictive models, that is, the quantum- based models are not tractable at this scale. Two options can be further considered: molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). MD solves the Newton equation of motion for each atom in the system. Trajectories are continuous and necessitate very short integration time steps that make the simulation cumbersome for durations beyond the nanosecond. Another drawback of the MD method is the general lack of adequate interatomic potential for highly disordered and heterogeneous systems.

Thus, provided the characteristics of reaction pathways are known, KMC methods allow the simulation of more ambitious systems in terms of size and duration of the simulated experiment, meeting the requirements of the next generation of processes in microelectronics. Also, the lattice- based KMC, because of its induced structural simplification, makes it easier to process the data concerning the atomic arrangement as a function of the implemented basic mechanisms. This contrasts with the difficulty in dealing with structural aspects in MD, where complex statistical methods have to be employed."

In contrast to molecular dynamics, where atoms are moving continuously in space, the lattice- based procedure developed in this KMC software allows a very efficient treatment of atomic displacements: the atoms discretely move from predefined sites to other sites according to transition probabilities. Obviously, this schematic picture is motivated by physicochemical considerations through the knowledge of the basic mechanisms and the investigation of lattice structure. This last point becomes crucial in the case of heterogeneous systems, where at least two different crystallographic structures are being considered. This is the case in our study, where metallic oxides are grown on an ultrathin silicon oxide, itself grown or deposited on a silicon substrate. First, a reliable and systematic way of representing the atom locations is needed. Then, the implementation of configurations makes the connection between a location and its chemical nature: for instance, a site may be unoccupied or occupied by Si, Hf, etc. We point out that this lattice picture gives the possibility of making schematic and comprehensive graphical views of the system and therefore of performing a simple analysis of the results that does not require complex post- processing of the data. In this description, where an atom is represented in its network site, its real location is implicitly somewhere around this particular site."

Overall crystallinity is defined when Hf and oxygen atoms are located in the predefine lattice sites. In this case, Hf may be fully or under- coordinated depending on the occupancy of the oxygen lattice sites around. When densification occurs, rearrangement of oxygen atoms should induce an increase of the coordination number."

Experimental evidence of crystalline grains for thick oxide or post- annealed films has been established. However, the structure close to interface, that is, the oxide structure near the silicon/silicon dioxide, is not known. Therefore, to correctly model this interface, one has to make a coincidence lattice site study. For us, it then appears judicious to consider the (100) face of the cubic phase of hafnia: it matches efficiently the (100) silicon surface structure, is geometrically easier to describe, and does not contradict or hinder the experimental results. Thus, the overall idea consists of building the model of location via a single cubic structure, keeping in mind that the real positions of atoms are \"somewhere around\" these arbitrary crystalline positions. The substrate will be a Si(100) surface functionalized by hydroxyl groups, which are known to be the active surface sites with regard to the precursor gas phase. 63"

Now we must formalize the possible chemical nature of species occupying these sites. Thus, the configuration, that is, the site occupation nature, should characterize the local atomic arrangement within the site. We introduce a data-processing structure that will take account not only the crystalline configuration but also the chemical functions, the various contaminants, and the molecular groupings with their substituent. Each element of grid will thus contain several fields of occupation. For the metal element, it is provided in molecular form in the precursor, is then incorporated as an adsorbed molecule, and finally, is stabilized in the crystalline state. Therefore, the field of metal occupation can be empty (value 0), be occupied by a molecular hafnium (value 1), or occupied by a crystalline hafnium (value 2). A crystalline state corresponds to the case where a hafnium is located somewhere around a preset site, while being based on the cubic cell of dense oxide. On the other hand, in its molecular state, the Hf atom is attached to the substrate by only one connection, that is, a treelike structure, after physisorption or chemisorption of the precursor molecule. It is advisable to distinguish these two states because their reactivities will be, without any doubt, different because one "

By convention, for the hydrolysis phase, adsorbed water will be represented by the value 3 in the metal field of occupation.

The elementary reaction steps that constitutes the basis of any KMC approach can emanate from literature data, ab initio calculations, or a KMC investigation itself (in particular cases where the code is ready for validation procedures). As an example, Figure 5 illustrates precursor chemisorption, followed by HCl desorption. The calculated activation energies, using ab initio DFT, can serve as preliminary input values for the kinetic Monte Carlo mechanisms. The results of ab initio calculations are summarized in Section 3.1. Further, ALD growth is complicated by other reaction steps, not just the precursor molecule's adsorption and hydrolysis. An example is the densification (Table 1). Indeed, a key technological question that arises during the film growth is the necessary phase transition of the interesting materials from their molecular structure in the gas-phase precursors to their solid-state structure in the deposited film. This is particularly true for metallic compounds, such as oxides "

However, the complexity of the densification process is such that our present KMC implementation includes no changes in Hf or O coordination number. Further, because of the intrinsic difficulty in consideration of reaction steps related to these phenomena, the set up of a DFT modeling strategy becomes tricky. Later on in the paper, densification will be clarified, and we will show how this problem can be overcome in the KMC."

Moreover, if one given event is forbidden and becomes authorized, its \"specific time\" is also updated (see Section 2.2.1.2b for details about this point). In contrast, if the event is authorized and remains authorized, its \"specific time\" is kept as is. In any other case, the forbidden event's \"specific time\" is set to a value greater than the overall experiment duration. If not reauthorized again, this event will never occur. To save computing time, the filtering procedure is only called when necessary by a \"smart call\" routine, Figure 6. Another way to save computing time is to consider modified probability sites (MPS). In this procedure, after the occurrence of a given event, one considers only a local reactualization of the sites/events/time of occurrence. Rigorously, all the sites/events could be reactualized, which would require a huge amount of computing time. This procedure is thus used on the basis of the"

Globally, it is expected from these results that the deposition with the desired coverage of a complete monolayer of precursors is a difficult task. The sticking of the precursor is low. The high activation barrier for decomposition is compared to the precursor non dissociative chemisorption. Moreover, the dissociative incorporation is reversible. The dissociated precursor molecule is itself thermodynamically unstable with respect to the chemisorbed state. This authorizes the precursor to recombine and to be rejected from the surface.

In the gas phase, metallic precursors exhibit a covalent molecular structure characterized by a small coordination number, whereas the resulting deposited metallic oxide has an ionic type of structure characterized by a large coordination number. This necessary phase transition has been poorly investigated to date in literature.50 In our recent work, we show that this chemical process is mediated by the presence of oxygen atoms: sharing them locally allows a local redistribution of oxygen atoms and metallic centers to operate the desired transition. This implies an increase of the coordination of both Hf and oxygen atoms and a \"more dense\" local reallocation of the atoms through the collapse of dendritic tree like structures into densely packed oxide films. The dendritic structures result from an accumulation of adsorbed molecules, preventing a dense structure by steric hindrance. However, the complexity of the densification process is such that our KMC model still poorly describe this phenomenon leading to no increase of the coordination number."

Densifications may also result from reactions between Cl or OH terminals in ionic (i), cluster (c), or tree (t) configurations.

Most of the Monte Carlo procedures used in condensed matter physics are static (the Metropolis algorithm for instance), and their interest concerns the equilibrium structure properties. KMC is totally different in philosophy. Here, the Monte Carlo technique is introduced for the stochastic aspects, in connection with the time incremental procedure, that is, it is not always the most probable event that occurs. Different algorithms do exist for KMC. We suggest in the following a procedure that becomes efficient, with regard of the more conventional BKL algorithm, when dealing with many different events related to the same mechanism, but having different probabilities. This means that the probability depends also on the site of occurrence. This is the case of systems where local deformation energy is taken into account (each event has therefore a different probability of occurrence) and where the system exhibits a complex chemistry."
