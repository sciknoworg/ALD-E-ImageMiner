Density functional theory within the hybrid functional is used to determine the detailed physicochemical mechanisms and associated energetics of the two half cycles taking place during the initial stage of film growth. A kinetic Monte Carlo model is then proposed that deals with the stochastic nature of the calculated DFT mechanisms and barriers. Beyond the chemical information emanating from DFT calculations, the lattice- based KMC approach requires preliminary physical considerations issued from the crystal structures that the system is intended to adopt. This is especially critical in the case of heterogeneous systems like oxides deposited on silicon. We also describe (i) how atomistic configuration changes are performed as a result of local events consisting in elementary reaction mechanisms occurring on specific lattice sites, (ii) the temporal dynamics, governed by transition probabilities, calculated for every event from DFT activation barriers, and (iii) the relation of KMC with the ALD experimental procedure. Some preliminary validation results of the whole multiscale strategy are given for illustration and pertinence with regard of the technological main issues.",

Unfortunately, the reduction of the  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  gate oxide thickness in agreement with Moore's law has led to unacceptable tunnelling and leakage current levels. So, the conventional  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  gate reaches its physical and electrical limitations. An intense effort to find a replacement for  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  as the gate dielectric for future MOS electronics has been under way for several years. For this purpose, the importance of high-  $k$  gate dielectrics has been well demonstrated. Indeed, in addition to showing a high dielectric constant, a potential high-  $k$  replacement must satisfy many stringent requirements, such as the high quality of the interface, a desired band alignment with silicon, and a large electronic gap. At present, the leading materials are  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  ,and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  oxides, considered as the first high-  $k$  generation candidates to meet these criteria and replace  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  For MOS applications,  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  is attractive because it exhibits a bulk permittivity of almost 25, a wide band gap  $(5.68~\\mathrm{eV})$  and a good thermodynamic stability in contact with silicon.

Indeed, each precursor is pulsed into the reaction chamber alternately, and the reaction between the incoming precursors and surface species is self- terminating. Thus atomic- level control of film growth is supposed to be achieved. Experimentally, ALD has been actively investigated for deposition of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}^{5 - 21}$  for which  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  are often used as precursors.22- 24 In practice, the quantity of metal atoms deposited per cycle depends on the temperature, on the chemical nature of the precursors used, and related reactive sites on the surface. For instance, Ritala et al. found that only a submonolayer of the  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  film is deposited during each cycle.22 Therefore, a detailed understanding of the basic mechanisms that take place during each cycle is required if one wants to optimize the deposition and to reach full monolayer coverage at each cycle. This is especially true for the few first deposited layers whose quality, in terms of interface defects, is of major importance for subsequent electrical properties. In recent studies, some groups have investigated specific problems of ALD of hafnia films, their structural, optical, and electrical characteristics.25- 28 They show that diffusion and solid- state reactions at the substrate- film interface may influence the film material and create or modify an interface layer between the film and substrate.29 On silicon substrates, these reactions could result in undesirable formation of defects, silicate or silicide layers, which may further significantly deteriorate the properties of the dielectric layer.29- 32 Others issues, such as contamination effects resulting from the uncontrolled precursor decomposition, are observed. In particular, chlorine contamination has been asserted and well documented on films grown with  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  precursors.20,33- 35 It is of great importance for optimal future experimental setups that a precise atomic level description of the basic reaction mechanisms responsible for the overall process of high-  $k$  film growth and also that their relation with the thermodynamic parameters be established. In this respect, the decomposition of  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  on the substrate and further hydrolysis of the resulting surface complex, that is,  $\\mathrm{SiO_2 - O - HfCl_3}$  should be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, today's state- of- the- art theoretical methods can play a decisive role in reduction of the expensive experimental efforts needed for screening large numbers of candidate materials and associated process parameters. Theoretical approaches can speed up the selection of suitable gate dielectrics and growth methods by limiting the experimental input needed. For these reasons, a detailed understanding of the basic mechanisms that take place during each cycle of ALD has been the subject of intensive research effort by several theoretical groups using first principles, especially via density functional theory.35- 51 In our group, we have considered the ab initio study of the initial stage of the ALD as being essential for the complete understanding and the control of the growth of the high-  $k$ $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  films for gate dielectrics applications.49- 51 Our final aim is to achieve the ambitious task of elaborating a new generation of tools dedicated to atomic scale simulation of technological process, for an optimization of experimental setups. Here, our strategy is to combine the ab initio level of calculations with kinetic Monte- Carlo techniques into a multiscale approach, which will incorporate enough reaction mechanisms to be ready for being tested against experimental setups. Rigorously, molecular dynamics should be a suitable tool to address atomic scale process simulation. However, microelectronic processes deal with mesoscopic structures, several millions of atoms, and cover timescales beyond seconds or minutes. Molecular dynamics is then limited for two major reasons: (i) interatomic potentials have to be generated, which is a particularly difficult task in the frame of heterostructures and interfaces, and (ii) timescales are limited to nanoseconds of experimental duration. Thus kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is an alternative procedure that is of great help in the modeling of microelectronic processes: a lattice- based model makes it possible to avoid the detailed description of continuous atomic trajectories, and the kinetics of the sequence of events is explicitly treated and can meet typical process durations. While traditional thermodynamic and kinetic models deal with average physical quantities, kinetic Monte Carlo is able to consider a wide range of possible configurations at the atomic scale and to choose only one random path out of all possible ones. This corresponds to an actual (ALD) experiment. The path is determined according to random numbers sampled according to transition probabilities between configurations. Obviously, the transition probabilities depend also on the local configuration, activation barriers and on the film deposition conditions, such as pressure and temperature. Moreover the role of each mechanistic step on an ensemble of interacting species makes it feasible to uncover process- dependent types of growth, kinetics, and their associated atomic arrangements. The present paper is dedicated to the description of the preliminary version of our KMC tool enabling the treatment of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  ALD from  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  precursors at the atomic scale. In the following, we will focus our attention on the basic ingredients needed to develop what we call a lattice- based KMC model. We will define a lattice framework able to represent the transition from the silicon diamond structure to the  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  crystalline structure. Then we introduce the concept of basic atomistic mechanisms and show how they can be derived from ab initio calculations. We will finally present the temporal dynamics rules of our model before showing validation and applications.",

KMC is a stochastic- based model aimed at simulation of film growth at the atomic scale, the final objective being to furnish alternative/new tools for replacement of the macroscopic conventional TCAD tools used for years by engineers in microelectronics. Indeed, from the engineering point of view, the main interest is in the microstructure that is produced under specific processing conditions. Such a model performs virtually the explicit experimental processing procedure event after event, at the atomic scale. This is operated through probabilistic rules that make the overall simulation comparable with an actual experiment.61,62 It involves millions of atoms with a time duration longer than the second. Unfortunately, the most predictive models, that is, the quantum- based models are not tractable at this scale. Two options can be further considered: molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). MD solves the Newton equation of motion for each atom in the system. Trajectories are continuous and necessitate very short integration time steps that make the simulation cumbersome for durations beyond the nanosecond. Another drawback of the MD method is the general lack of adequate interatomic potential for highly disordered and heterogeneous systems. This is particularly true for microelectronics semiconductor/oxide interfaces such as silicon/high-  $k$  gate oxides. KMC appears to be a simplification compared with MD: MD continuous trajectories are replaced with discrete atomic jumps. A prior knowledge of these hoppings is needed and must be listed from any other source: quantum- based models or experimental characterization. Thus, provided the characteristics of reaction pathways are known, KMC methods allow the simulation of more ambitious systems in terms of size and duration of the simulated experiment, meeting the requirements of the next generation of processes in microelectronics. Also, the lattice- based KMC, because of its induced structural simplification, makes it easier to process the data concerning the atomic arrangement as a function of the implemented basic mechanisms. This contrasts with the difficulty in dealing with structural aspects in MD, where complex statistical methods have to be employed.",

Obviously, this schematic picture is motivated by physicochemical considerations through the knowledge of the basic mechanisms and the investigation of lattice structure. This last point becomes crucial in the case of heterogeneous systems, where at least two different crystallographic structures are being considered. This is the case in our study, where metallic oxides are grown on an ultrathin silicon oxide, itself grown or deposited on a silicon substrate. First, a reliable and systematic way of representing the atom locations is needed. Then, the implementation of configurations makes the connection between a location and its chemical nature: for instance, a site may be unoccupied or occupied by Si, Hf, etc. We point out that this lattice picture gives the possibility of making schematic and comprehensive graphical views of the system and therefore of performing a simple analysis of the results that does not require complex post- processing of the data.

However, the structure close to interface, that is, the oxide structure near the silicon/silicon dioxide, is not known. Therefore, to correctly model this interface, one has to make a coincidence lattice site study. For us, it then appears judicious to consider the (100) face of the cubic phase of hafnia: it matches efficiently the (100) silicon surface structure, is geometrically easier to describe, and does not contradict or hinder the experimental results. Thus, the overall idea consists of building the model of location via a single cubic structure, keeping in mind that the real positions of atoms are \"somewhere around\" these arbitrary crystalline positions.

We introduce a data-processing structure that will take account not only the crystalline configuration but also the chemical functions, the various contaminants, and the molecular groupings with their substituent. Each element of grid will thus contain several fields of occupation. For the metal element, it is provided in molecular form in the precursor, is then incorporated as an adsorbed molecule, and finally, is stabilized in the crystalline state. Therefore, the field of metal occupation can be empty (value 0), be occupied by a molecular hafnium (value 1), or occupied by a crystalline hafnium (value 2). A crystalline state corresponds to the case where a hafnium is located somewhere around a preset site, while being based on the cubic cell of dense oxide.

The elementary reaction steps that constitutes the basis of any KMC approach can emanate from literature data, ab initio calculations, or a KMC investigation itself (in particular cases where the code is ready for validation procedures). As an example, Figure 5 illustrates precursor chemisorption, followed by HCl desorption. The calculated activation energies, using ab initio DFT, can serve as preliminary input values for the kinetic Monte Carlo mechanisms. The results of ab initio calculations are summarized in Section 3.1. Further, ALD growth is complicated by other reaction steps, not just the precursor molecule's adsorption and hydrolysis. An example is the densification (Table 1). Indeed, a key technological question that arises during the film growth is the necessary phase transition of the interesting materials from their molecular structure in the gas-phase precursors to their solid-state structure in the deposited film. This is particularly true for metallic compounds, such as oxides  $(\\mathrm{HfO_2})$  where the metal has a covalent bonding structure in the precursor, with a small coordination number, while the metal oxides have mainly ionic structures with large coordination numbers. However, the complexity of the densification process is such that our present KMC implementation includes no changes in Hf or O coordination number. Further, because of the intrinsic difficulty in consideration of reaction steps related to these phenomena, the set up of a DFT modeling strategy becomes tricky. Later on in the paper, densification will be clarified, and we will show how this problem can be overcome in the KMC.",

Geometrical structures and energetic diagram of the total system along the decomposition reaction pathways of  $\\mathrm{HfCl_4}$  on the  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  substrate are presented in Figure 5. A chemisorbed state is found where  $\\mathrm{Hf / O}$  interaction is occurring without substantial modification of the precursor integrity (0.48 eV adsorption energy). This adsorption energy is weaker than those obtained by Musgrave and co- workers.66 This difference is the result of the differences in cluster geometry and basis set. Both parameters are more extended in our study. A dissociation path is then calculated, and we obtain an activation barrier of  $0.88\\mathrm{eV}$ . This barrier is higher than the  $0.7\\mathrm{eV}$  barrier obtained by Widjaja et al.68 The difference is caused by the methodology used in the search of transition state and the surface models that are different. Beyond the saddle point, HCl molecule formation is observed during minimization with subsequent adsorption of this molecule on top of the dimer inserted oxygen atom. Globally, it is expected from these results that the deposition with the desired coverage of a complete monolayer of precursors is a difficult task. The sticking of the precursor is low. The high activation barrier for decomposition is compared to the precursor non dissociative chemisorption. Moreover, the dissociative incorporation is reversible. The dissociated precursor molecule is itself thermodynamically unstable with respect to the chemisorbed state. This authorizes the precursor to recombine and to be rejected from the surface. Fortunately, the HCl byproduct desorption is fast, because of its low activation energy of only  $0.12\\mathrm{eV}$  and inhibits further reverse reaction.

This necessary phase transition has been poorly investigated to date in literature.50 In our recent work, we show that this chemical process is mediated by the presence of oxygen atoms: sharing them locally allows a local redistribution of oxygen atoms and metallic centers to operate the desired transition. This implies an increase of the coordination of both Hf and oxygen atoms and a \"more dense\" local reallocation of the atoms through the collapse of dendritic tree like structures into densely packed oxide films. The dendritic structures result from an accumulation of adsorbed molecules, preventing a dense structure by steric hindrance.

Beyond cycle 5, the growth is stopped. This is caused by the inability of the densification mechanisms to be fully efficient. An examination of the final structure indicates specific sites where further densification mechanisms should occur but cannot be performed by the mechanisms already implemented in our software package. We are currently considering rewriting the algorithm used to treat densification mechanisms to overcome this problem. The rate of crystallinity follows the same tendency and is stabilized around  $62\\%$  , meaning that the densification had taken place, but not fully, because of, at least, an unsatisfactory description of densification. However, one cannot be satisfied with this situation because the experiments show that the growth continues, certainly slowly, after the strong coverage observed after the first cycle.70,71 An opening of the siloxane bridges by a water molecule has been suggested that could allow the total coverage to be reached. The opening of the siloxane bridges is postponed during the hydrolysis phases and could bring additional reactive sites on the initial surface.
