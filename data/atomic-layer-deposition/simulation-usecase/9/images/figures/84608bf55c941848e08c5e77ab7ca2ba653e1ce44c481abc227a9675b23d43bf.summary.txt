The chart illustrates the relationship between densification barriers and coverage/crystallinity percentages. It shows that as the densification barrier increases, the crystallinity percentage rises sharply while the coverage percentage remains relatively constant until a densification barrier of approximately 1.4 eV, after which both decrease significantly.
