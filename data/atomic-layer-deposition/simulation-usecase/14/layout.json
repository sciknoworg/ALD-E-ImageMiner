The obtained results are discussed at the light of a multi- model approach that enables process simulation at the atomic scale via Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The impact of the proposed densification mechanisms on the growth is demonstrated.

Leaving the detailed processing conditions aside, a general but fundamental question that arises during growth is the necessary phase transition of the interesting materials from their molecular structure in the gas phase to their solid state structure in the deposited film. This is particularly true for metallic compounds such as metallic oxides. Indeed, in these cases, the metal has a covalent bonding structure, with a small coordination number when considered as a precursor in the gas phase, while at in its end deposited ionic structure, it exhibits a large coordination number. The origin of these findings, which has been referred to as densification in the study by Dkhissi et al. [3] lies in the above structural phase transition. The case of "

As compared to DVD, this technique prevents from gas phase reaction/densification since there is no contact between water and precursor molecules. So the densification is expected only in the specific context of each ALD cycle. Each exposure phase is separated by a purge phase using an inert gas to remove the remaining unreacted precursor molecules and unwanted reaction products. Actually, it has been experimentally observed that under usual ALD growth conditions, approximately ten cycles are needed to obtain the complete coverage of the initial substrate, suggesting a partial monolayer growth per cycle. Moreover, the density and the coordination number of the deposited oxide near the substrate surface are much lower than those in the bulk oxide, but increase with increasing the film thickness. In more general terms, growth of such an oxide on silicon is still not well understood for two main reasons: ALD growth is associated with complex physicochemical mechanisms and it is strongly dependent on the deposition procedure, temperature conditions or preparation conditions of the substrate.

The initial deposition step is endothermic and leads to the formation of a strand or tree like complex on the surface (see black curve) as already known from the literature. Then, densifying this complex can be operated in two different ways. The red curve indicates an exothermic path in which a Cl atom is exchanged between the precursor molecule and the model surface. This almost barrierless exothermic path can be seen as a source for Chlorine contamination of the substrate. However, the endothermic path indicated in blue where a hydroxyl group of the surface can be bonded to the precursor leading to a double bridging oxygen of the deposited Hafnium atom. This process is characterized by two activation barriers (0.24 and "

Fig. 1 shows its chemical pathway and Table 1 resumes energy gain and barriers. For both dimerization reactions, the first H transfer is followed by two mechanisms in competition. The first is desorption of the hydrogenate molecule formed. The second is the direct 2nd deprotonation whereas the hydrogenate molecule formed is still physisorbed. We see that deprotonation reactions are endothermic, subject to backreactions, in the limit of the hydrogenated product desorption. But the overall energy of this two molecule formation is in the same order as intermolecular reactions. Therefore, at the processing temperature, H migrations will occur and appear to move freely at the cluster surfaces, jumping from O bridging sites, to OH groups, and vice versa."

The first cycle coverage is then directly related to the hydroxyl function of the silicon surface and then the substrate preparation method. After this first cycle, the growth continues on top of the first deposited layer, filling up the successive layers. But this mode of growth does not contribute to the coverage of the initial substrate due to the lack of reactive sites on the silicon substrate. The coverage will though continue to increase slowly thanks to the first deposited layer as a result of on- site densifications. The experimental observation of a slowing down of the coverage rate is explained, by our simulations, as a transition from the nucleation to the densification mechanism. The inter- site densification mechanisms, little by little, authorize bridging of the non reactive surface zones. This is clearly seen in Fig. 3 where the simulation taking densification mechanisms into account follows perfectly the experimental results. On the other hand, the coverage remains constant in simulations which do not take densification mechanisms into account and where tree lie structures are observed."

An attempt to calculate densification mechanisms is established and preliminary gas phase calculations allow determining densification activation barriers. The introduction of these densification mechanisms and associated calculated barriers is shown to reproduce well experimental results on the coverage versus ALD deposition cycles. The first two regimes of growth are observed: the initial regime at the first cycle, driven by the reactions of precursor adsorption and further decomposition on the silicon substrate and the transitional regime, which thanks to the action of densification mechanisms leads to full coverage of the substrate once all adhesion sites of the silicon surface are consumed."
