Recently, InGaAs has attracted attention as a potential candidate material for a new channel layer for a high- speed and low- power III- V based metal- oxide- semiconductor field- effect transistor (MOSFET) [1]. In particular, it is a possible candidate for the gate material in the structure of next- generation semiconductor devices, such as fin- field- effect transistors (FinFETs) and nanowire field- effect transistors (NWFETs), which consist of 3D device structures which "

Therefore, in this study, as a feasibility study of an anisotropic ALE for three- component III- V compounds, the ALE characteristics of InGaAs, which is one of the most promising gate materials for next- generation FinFETs and NWFETs, has been investigated.

On the other hand, if the energy of the chlorine ion is too low (below the threshold), the adsorption time required for chlorine chemisorption on InGaAs surface is increased significantly because chlorine is not easily chemisorbed on the InGaAs surface. To investigate an optimized condition for the adsorption, the effect of the first grid voltage (acceleration grid voltage) of the ICP ion gun and the chlorine adsorption time on the InGaAs etch depth during the chlorine adsorption step was investigated and the results are shown in figures 3(a) and (b), respectively. In figure 3(a), to investigate the etch possibility of InGaAs during the adsorption step, the InGaAs was exposed for a long time of "

The increase in surface roughness of InGaAs etched by RIE compared to the InGaA etched by ALE could be related to the formation of an In- rich modified layer formed on the etched InGaAs surface while no such modified layer was observed for the InGaAs etched by ALE. Therefore, the results showed that, by using the ALE technique, InGaAs can be etched selectively and with significantly lower surface damage and contamination compared to conventional RIE, and it could be an essential etch method for subnanometer- scale device technologies."

Using the ALE method, a saturated InGaAs etch rate of about 1.1 Å/ cycle could be obtained and the etch rate was remained constant regardless the etch cycles up to 400 cycles, therefore, the InGaAs etch depth could be controlled precisely with atomic precision by controlling etch cycles in addition to the infinite etch selectivities over other materials such as mask materials and dielectrics. No significant changes in surface roughness and composition of etched InGaAs surface were also observed after the 100 cycles of ALE. Therefore, it is believed that the ALE method used for InGaAs etching can be applied as an essential etch method for next generation subnanometer scale device technologies."
