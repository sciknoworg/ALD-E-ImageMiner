To take nanostructuring by dry etching to the next level, there is a fast growing interest in so- called atomic layer etching processes, which are considered the etching counterpart of atomic layer deposition processes. In this article, past research efforts are reviewed and the key defining characteristics of atomic layer etching are identified, such as cyclic step- wise processing, self- limiting surface chemistry, and repeated removal of atomic layers (not necessarily a full monolayer) of the material. Subsequently, further parallels are drawn with the more mature and mainstream technology of atomic layer deposition from which lessons and concepts are extracted that can be beneficial for advancing the field of atomic layer etching."

As devices approach single- digit nanometer critical dimensions (CDs), tolerances are required that are on the order of a few atoms. In addition, aspect ratios will become larger and topographies more complicated. The ability to precisely and selectively add and/or remove functional materials at an atomic scale has become imperative. The overall challenge in the processing of semiconductor devices lies therefore, in the accurate control of the material properties as well as in the control of the nanometer dimensions, hence in \"materials control\" and \"dimensions control\". This puts a heavy burden on processing techniques such as deposition and etch."

Instead, ALD is a cyclic process in which film growth takes place by a repetition of cycles with every cycle consisting of several steps. Typically, an ALD cycle consists of four basic steps: two reactant dosing steps that are separated by two purge steps. Thus each ALD cycle can be divided into two halfreactions, i.e., half- reaction A during the first reactant dosing step (for the first reactant the term \"precursor\" is often employed) and halfreaction B during the second reactant dosing step (for the second half reaction the term \"co- reactant\" is appropriate). In each half- reaction, chemical reactions take place at the surface of the film in such a way that the surface chemistry is self- limiting. Thus half- reactions A and B can contribute to film growth but add at most one atomic layer (defined here as a layer of atoms, not necessarily a full monolayer). Hence, after a full \"AB cycle\" with sufficiently long dosing times for the precursor and co- reactant species (i.e., under so- called \"saturation conditions\"), the film thickness is increased by a well- defined value representing at most one atomic layer of material independent of the exact dosing times. This well- defined thickness is very repeatable cycle- over- cycle such that the targeted film thickness can be reached very precisely upon careful detection of the required number of ALD cycles. Evidently, the self- limiting surface chemistry is also the reason"

In this basic approach, the control of the deposited or etched thickness is limited as the deposited or etched thickness is \"flux-controlled\". Variations in the process conditions easily lead to variations in the flux of species and hence, in the final deposited or etched thickness, both over multiple deposition runs (i.e., wafer-to-wafer) or over the substrate area (i.e., within-wafer). (b) In a pulsed process, the continuous process is basically divided up into pulses and the pulses are repeated until the deposited or etched thickness has been reached. When the pulse length is well-defined, pulsing provides typically additional control over the continuous process but due to the flux-controlled nature similar drawbacks as in the continuous process hold. (c) Atomic layer processes are \"surface-controlled\" as they are based on self-limiting surface chemistries during, e.g., two half-reactions (A and B) that make up a full cycle. Every cycle yields a well-defined, fixed thickness that is deposited or etched when the time per cycle for the half-cycles is sufficiently long (i.e., when working in \"saturated conditions\"). This means that the thickness of the deposited or etched film can be controlled very accurately by choosing the right number of cycles. This holds when comparing one deposition run to another but it also leads to an excellent uniformity over the full substrate. Ideal atomic layer processes are very independent of variations in timings or process conditions."

Other embodiments of ALD have also been developed but they all share the same defining characteristics where the processes take place cycle- wise with several steps per cycle and are based on self- limiting surface chemistry. Meanwhile, a large variety of ALD equipment has entered the market, including tools for single- wafer and batch processing, energy- enhanced and plasma- enhanced ALD tools, and more recently, even spatial ALD equipment. These developments have made ALD currently a mainstream technology for creating uniform and conformal nanomaterials and nanostructures with atomic scale accuracy."

In the past 40 years Moore's Law could be continued by the numerous developments in plasma etching with continuously higher levels of dimensional control. Several of such developments have, for example, been enabled by approaches relying on pulsed operation, i.e., by time- modulation of the power, gas flows or bias voltages. Yet, every new technology node imposes new challenges in selectivity, plasma damage, aspect- ratio- dependent etching (ARDE) and line- edge roughness (LER). These challenges related to current dry etching techniques provide a window of opportunity for being potentially tackled by an atomic scale etching method analogous to ALD known as atomic layer etching (here abbreviated as \"ALEt\", see also below). Although several efforts have been undertaken to develop layer- by- layer methods with precise etch control similar to its ALD counterpart, the development of ALEt has comparatively lagged behind."

Since then, a large set of publications has appeared in scientific literature and the method has come to be known by a variety of other names, namely: digital etching, layer- by- layer etching, molecular- layer etching, plasma atomic layer etching (PALE), etc. Yet, the original name of \"atomic layer etching\" coined in the first patent has remained most popular. The acronym \"ALEt\" has often been used to distinguish the method from the abbreviation of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), the latter being used to identify atomic layer deposition processes before the term atomic layer deposition (with acronym \"ALD\") gained widespread adoption."

To overcome the drawback of such long cycle times, an ALEt method incorporating pulsed plasmas has been proposed.36,37 The concept relies on the formation of a self- limited halogenated surface layer in the presence of a plasma without initial substrate bias thus preventing ion bombardment induced etching. By using pulsed biasing, the halogenated surface layer is sputtered off faster than it can reform. Complete removal of this layer inhibits any further etching of the substrate provided the ion energy is below the sputtering threshold of the substrate. The bias is then switched off which again leads to the formation of a halogenated layer and the cycle can be repeated to obtain a fast ALEt process."

They have been restricted to a few particular embodiments, material systems, and chemistries and the approaches developed till now have had limited success and/or a limited range of potential applicability. Yet, the efforts also demonstrate the potential opportunities provided by the ALEt process concept, particularly in view of the current developments in the semiconductor industry. To significantly advance the applicability of ALEt, it is worthwhile to look in more detail at the ins and outs of ALD. It can be meaningful to learn from the state- of- the- art features of this technology as well as from its historical developments and emerging trends. Identifying similarities and differences between ALEt and its ALD counterpart can certainly contribute to expanding the toolbox of ALEt processes with sufficient performance to tackle future challenges in semiconductor and other device manufacturing."

From the research efforts so far, it is clear that ALEt is a layer- by- layer etching method with - similar to ALD - the following defining characteristics (see Fig. 1): the process takes place cycle- wise with several steps per cycle, and is based on self- limiting surface chemistry. However, contrary to what is claimed or suggested in many previous reports (especially in the work related to silicon etching), it is not necessary or useful to restrict ALEt to processes in which a full monolayer of material is etched. To achieve atomic layer etch precision in a very repeatable manner, the processes do not necessarily have to yield one monolayer per cycle. Removal of a submonolayer per cycle is adequate and, as a matter of fact, even better as the etch control can be even more precise. Note, that in virtually all ALD processes, the thickness increase per cycle is also limited to less than a monolayer (see Table I) although there have been some cases reported in which the thickness increase is more than a monolayer.41,42 Yet whether the decrease in thickness after one cycle of ALEt is less or more than a monolayer, atomic scale precision in thickness and atomically smooth surfaces can still be obtained. In fact, it would be more sensible to add the criterion of (atomically) smooth surfaces to the definition of ALEt. Furthermore, note that the limitation to processes that yield one monolayer per cycle is only well- defined when etching single- crystalline materials such as silicon. A monolayer is very ill- defined when etching amorphous or polycrystalline materials, for example high- "

So far, the ALEt technique has manifested itself mostly based on a chemically enhanced process in which passivation of the surface of the material to be etched with a layer of adsorbed precursor species decreases the activation energy required by energetic particle bombardment to remove that layer (see The early days of atomic layer etching section). Limiting the discussion to a process with two half- reactions and four steps per cycle for simplicity, it is more relevant and more comprehensive to identify an adsorption step and an activation step. In the adsorption step, the surface is exposed to a precursor gas which adsorbs onto the surface in a self- limiting way, i.e., preventing further multilayer adsorption. This adsorption of a precise amount of precursor is similar for ALEt and ALD. This similarity also holds for the purge steps that separate the two half- reactions and which remove excess precursor species and reaction products from the reactor."

In ALEt, the surface is activated by co- reactant species which remove volatile etch products from the surface in a self- limiting way. After purging, this leads to the removal of one atomic layer from the surface (not necessarily a monolayer as discussed earlier). For ALD on the other hand, the activation step consists of exposing the surface to a co- reactant that completes the addition of an atomic layer of the material to be deposited on the surface, and, at the same time activates the surface for the next ALD cycle. The activation of the surface for the next cycle in the third step is a strict criterion for both ALD and ALEt and this holds also for the self- limiting nature of the second half- cycle. For ALD, whether the elements of the co- reactant are added to the surface layer or not is insignificant from a conceptual point of view. Some co- reactants only activate the surface without contributing to growth, e.g., ALD of W from "

In these steps, the surface is exposed to reactants, here defined as precursor in step 1 and co-reactant in step 3. Steps 2 and 4 are purge steps. The cycles, and hence the process steps, are repeated multiple times when etching or depositing a film. Every cycle removes or adds an atomic layer from or to the film for ALEt and ALD, respectively. The saturation curves show that exposure to the reactants in steps 1 and 3 should be sufficiently long to reach saturation. The progress in between these steps should be sufficiently long to avoid parasitic CVD or parasitic etch reactions that compromise the ALEt or ALD character of the processes."

In case of ALD, one needs to verify whether or not an atomic layer of material has been added to the film independent of the dosing times as long as these are sufficiently long. The same holds for the removal of one atomic layer in ALEt. In both cases, this can be done by varying the dosing times for one step while keeping the dosing times for the other step(s) sufficiently long [see Fig. 3c]. One should also ensure that no atomic layer has been added or removed with zero dosing time for the precursor or co- reactant. If the latter does not hold true, the processes do not - strictly speaking - consist of two half- reactions and subsequently, the condition of an atomic layer deposition or etching process is not met. Another aspect is the purging after the two half- reactions. The purges should be long enough to ensure that excess precursor molecules and reaction products are completely removed from the reactor before the co- reactant is introduced, and vice versa. When the purging times are too short, precursor and co- reactant molecules can interact leading to parasitic CVD reactions occurring during ALD. Consequently, key features of ALD such as precise growth control, excellent conformality and unparalleled uniformity are compromised. For ALEt, a similar phenomenon can occur, i.e., parasitic etch, which means that the etching is not restricted to one well- defined atomic layer. For example, in the processes reported for Si etching by "

From this perspective it is possible to identify some clear similarities and differences between ALEt and ALD (see Fig. 4). What both processes (should) have in common is that they should lead to a very good uniformity over a large substrate area, i.e., basically over the full wafer size when processing wafer- based semiconductor devices. For ideal ALEt and ALD processes, this aspect is guaranteed by the fact that the processes are surface- controlled and self- limiting. This provides the opportunity to expose the wafer surface for a sufficiently long period to the precursor and co- reactant doses such that saturation of the surface chemistry can be reached over the full substrate area without multilayer removal or addition on highly- exposed surface regions. Obviously, another similarity lies in the control of the atomic layer processes: every cycle should lead to precise removal or addition of a well- defined atomic layer for ALEt and ALD, respectively. However, major differences between ALEt and ALD can be identified when considering the processing of 3D features at the substrate surface. The fact that ALD can yield very conformal films on demanding 3D topologies is a key asset of ALD intrinsic to the process. When depositing a film in, e.g., high aspect ratio trenches or holes, ALD processes will deposit a film with uniform thickness across the entire surface area of the substrate which includes the sidewalls and the bottom of the trenches or holes [see Fig. 4b]. Ideally, this is independent of the surface density of the features and their corresponding pitch. For the etching counterpart, the desired situation is however different. Dry etching is generally carried out to create vertical structures such as (high aspect ratio) trenches and holes within the surface region of the substrate and, therefore, anisotropic etch processes are generally employed. The anisotropy is typically achieved by directional"

When processing a subtrate with thre-dimsonal feures, the situation for AEt and ALD is however diffeent. For ALD, the coverage of thre-dimsonal feures is simiar thoghout the feures and comparable to the planar surface, hce the conformality of ALD-preared films is exellnt. For etching proceses such as ALEt, there is generally interest in etching vertical feares which requires anisotropic proceses in which only material is removed from the bottom of the vertical feature. In other cases, isotropic etching can be desired. In this case, the material should be etched equally on all exposed surfaces, indednt of the otion of the local sence on the subtrate. For ALEt, alo the selectivity of the etch process is key. Idally, only the to-be-etched material should be removed and not masking materials or materials lying underneath the to-be-etched material."

In this manner, the patterns to be etched can be effectively transferred to the substrate through the pre- defined openings in a hard mask covering the substrate material (see also discussion about selectivity below). Thus, if the etching of vertical structures is intended, the ALEt processes should be designed to have an anisotropic character. This is, e.g., the case for ALEt processes in which the co- reactant consists of directional, energetic species such as ions, electrons or energetic atoms from a neutralized ion beam. In the research efforts reported so far (see The early days of atomic layer etching section), this has often been the case. However, such anisotropic (\"non- conformal\") etching is only one possible manifestation of ALEt. It can be envisioned that isotropic (\"conformal\") etching by ALEt processes is also imperative for particular situations. This will however impose quite different requirements on the ALEt process steps, in particular on the co- reactants used. For example, ALEt processes that rely on a co- reactant consisting only of directional species are not an option for isotropic etching. A true \"reverse ALD\" process is probably more suited for isotropic etching, e.g., an ALEt process which is purely thermally driven."

These reactors can be optimized for precursor and co- reactant dosing while at the same time accounting for the design and implementation of versatile co- reactant sources. These co- reactants can be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons and photons, etc., and they can be delivered from the gas phase isotropically or directionally, e.g., using beams. ALEt processes based on energetic ions will require accurate ion- energy control, e.g., by incorporating advanced substrate biasing schemes yielding monodisperse ion energies which can be precisely controlled. Note that (advanced) substrate biasing is already at the heart of the technology in plasma etching while it has just entered the field of plasma- enhanced ALD. Furthermore, when working with plasma- based co- reactants, process and reactor design should take into account whether or not surface reaction products liberated from the surface during the co- reactant step can be dissociated in the plasma, e.g., by electron- impact. These dissociated reaction products can interact again with the surface and lead to additional etching or (re)deposition. Such effects have clearly been observed for plasma- enhanced ALD processes. Next, also equipment- related challenges will exist that are economically driven. A particularly important challenge lies in reaching sufficiently high throughput numbers for the processes. So far, ALEt processes suffer from long cycle times, even much more so than many ALD processes. However, at this point inspiration can also be derived from the developments and progresses made in ALD. Approaches such as operating under not- fully saturated conditions to reduce cycle times or resorting to spatial ALEt concepts, similar to spatial ALD processes, can also provide pathways for increasing the throughput of ALEt reactors, as illustrated in Fig. 7. It goes without saying that eventually, it is the application that will determine the tolerance thresholds for the processes involved and their parameters, not the fact of whether the processes themselves are strictly ALEt or not."

In (a), the approach is shown where the process is not operated under fully saturated conditions. When working with slightly shorter exposure times, the cycle time can significantly be reduced (e.g., by a factor of two) while the thickness deposited or removed is only slightly reduced. For many processes and device architectures, the level of growth for etch control remains acceptable. In (b), the so-called spatial atomic layer process is shown. The cycles are not carried out in the time domain but in the spatial domain. It is noted however, that developing appropriate processes for spatial ALD is not straightforward and this is probably even more so for spatial ALEt."

Being the etch counterpart of the commercially established method of atomic layer deposition (ALD), the aim of this article is to draw parallels between ALEt and ALD in order to more precisely define atomic layer etching, introduce a generalized ALEt cycle and identify similarities and differences between the two processes. It is expected that this will assist in significantly advancing the field of ALEt, both through conceptual considerations as well as by highlighting practical guidelines and recommendations. ALEt has been researched already for over 25 years now with relatively limited endeavors and successes. However, this does not mean that the progress will remain slow. For ALD, it also took 25 years before interest in this technology increased explosively owing to the fact that atomic layer precision in deposition became highly necessary. From that point onwards, many breakthroughs in both research and industrial applications were realized. A similar situation seems to exist at the moment for ALEt although the application range for this process will be smaller than that for ALD (the latter having many applications both within and outside the semiconductor industry). Moreover, ALEt seems to have process requirements that are less trivial and more demanding. However, continued development of ALEt processes and equipment will evidently advance the field of etching even if ideal ALEt processes remain unfeasible over the coming years. Research on ALEt will certainly contribute to etching with more atomic layer precision.Finally, it is noted that a recently appeared review article by Karnik et al. addresses some similar considerations as presented in this article."
