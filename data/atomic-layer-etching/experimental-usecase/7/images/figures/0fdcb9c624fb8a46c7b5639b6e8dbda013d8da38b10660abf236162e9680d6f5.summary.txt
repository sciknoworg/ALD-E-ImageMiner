The chart illustrates three different deposition/etching processes: continuous, pulsed, and atomic layer. Each process shows how the deposited or etched thickness changes over time or cycles, with the continuous process showing a steady increase, the pulsed process showing a linear increase with discrete steps, and the atomic layer process showing a stepwise increase with alternating A and B layers.
