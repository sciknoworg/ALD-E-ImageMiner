        "text": "ABSTRACT: Two- dimensional (2D) layered materials offer unique properties that make them attractive for continued scaling in electronic and optoelectronic device applications. Successful integration of 2D materials into semiconductor manufacturing requires high- volume and high- precision processes for deposition and etching. Several promising large- scale deposition approaches have been reported for a range of 2D materials, but fewer studies have reported removal processes. Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is a scalable processing technique that offers precise control over isotropic material removal. In this work, we report a thermal ALE process for molybdenum disulfide  $(\\mathrm{MoS}_2)$ . We show that  $\\mathrm{MoF}_6$  can be used as a fluorination source, which, when combined with alternating exposures of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ , etches both amorphous and crystalline  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  films deposited by atomic layer deposition. To characterize the ALE process and understand the etching reaction mechanism, in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) experiments were performed. From temperature- dependent in situ QCM experiments, the mass change per cycle was  $- 5.7\\mathrm{ng / cm}^2$  at  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  and reached  $- 270.6\\mathrm{ng / cm}^2$  at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , nearly  $50\\times$  greater. The temperature dependence followed Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy of  $13\\pm 1\\mathrm{kcal / mol}$ . At  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , QCM revealed a mass gain following exposure to  $\\mathrm{MoF}_6$  and a net mass loss after exposure to  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ . FTIR revealed the consumption of  $\\mathrm{Mo - O}$  species and formation of  $\\mathrm{Mo - F}$  and  $\\mathrm{MoF}_x = \\mathrm{O}$  species following exposures of  $\\mathrm{MoF}_6$  and the reverse behavior following  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  exposures. QMS measurements, combined with thermodynamic calculations, supported the removal of Mo and S through the formation of volatile  $\\mathrm{MoF}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  byproducts. The proposed etching mechanism involves a two- stage oxidation of Mo through the ALE half- reactions. Etch rates of  $0.5\\mathrm{A / }$  cycle for amorphous films and  $0.2\\mathrm{A / }$  cycle for annealed films were measured by ex situ ellipsometry, X- ray reflectivity, and transmission electron microscopy. Precisely etching amorphous films and subsequently annealing them yielded crystalline, few- layer  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  thin films. This thermal  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  ALE process provides a new mechanism for fluorination- based ALE and offers a low- temperature approach for integrating amorphous and crystalline 2D  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  films into high- volume device manufacturing with tight thermal budgets.",

No mass change was observed at an etch temperature of  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . When the temperature was increased slightly to  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , a small mass change was observed and calculated to be  $\\mathrm{MCPC}_{150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = - 5.7$ $\\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$ . At  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , the calculated  $\\mathrm{MCPC}_{200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = - 17.5$ $\\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$ , deviating slightly from the earlier calculated  $\\sim 19 \\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$ . Next, etching at  $250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  showed a much higher mass change of  $\\mathrm{MCPC}_{250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = - 88.7 \\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$ . Lastly, when the temperature was elevated to  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , the  $\\mathrm{MCPC}_{300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = - 270.6 \\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$ , an order of magnitude higher than at  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . While these etching results are based on QCM observations for etching an amorphous  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  film, it is interesting to compare these etch rates to the mass equivalent of a crystalline  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  monolayer, which is roughly  $307 \\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$ . Thus, at  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , the mass equivalent of  $6\\%$  of a monolayer is etched per cycle, while the mass equivalent of  $88\\%$  of a monolayer is etched per cycle at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . These results suggest that higher temperatures help volatilize and remove more material, and an Arrhenius plot of the MCPC data, shown in Figure 5.5b of the Supporting Information, is consistent with an activated process. For the etching at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , it was observed that there was mass loss after both the  $\\mathrm{MoF}_6$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  pulses. This result suggests the elevated temperature leads to fluorination and subsequent volatilization of residual  $\\mathrm{MoO}_x$  species remaining on the surface following the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  pulse. Additionally, reports of  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  etching by thermal annealing and annealing in an  $\\mathrm{O}_2 / \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  environment show the primary source of etching was the oxidation of  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$ , and subsequent volatilization formed  $\\mathrm{MoO}_3^{20}$  or  $\\mathrm{MoO}_2(\\mathrm{OH})_2$  species. This behavior was observed at temperatures of 330 and  $350^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . For our process, it can be assumed that the higher temperatures and additional thermal energy promote etching during fluorination after the  $\\mathrm{MoF}_6$  pulse and volatilization of molybdenum oxide/hydroxide species after the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  pulse.",

This  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  thin film served as the starting surface for our in situ FTIR investigation of the  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  ALE surface chemistry. The red trace in Figure 4a shows the FTIR spectrum following the first  $\\mathrm{MoF}_6$  exposure on the  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  surface. In this difference spectrum, the spectrum from the initial ALD  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  on  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  nanoparticles has been subtracted.

Similarly, the in situ QMS measurements suggest that  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  is the most abundant sulfur- containing byproduct formed during the  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  exposures (Figure S4). We note that elemental sulfur may form during the  $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$  ALE reactions and desorb from the surface as  $\\mathrm{S}_8(\\mathrm{g})$ , but our QMS would not detect this species as it would likely condense before reaching the QMS ionizer.

While each of these reactions has a negative free energy, indicating thermodynamic favorability, eq 3 has a free energy value nearly five times higher than eq 2 and nearly two times higher than eq 4.

Furthermore, the lack of defects within the exfoliated flake could also prevent available reactive sites for oxidation and subsequent etching, again leading to the lack of observed surface changes.
