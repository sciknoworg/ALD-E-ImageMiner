| Chart Type | Description |
|---|---|
| a) Reactive Ion | Cl+ 50 eV impacting a surface creating a rougher texture with RMS=2.3 nm over 1x1 µm area |
| b) Inert Ion | Ar+ 50 eV impacting a surface creating a smoother texture with RMS=0.4 nm over 1x1 µm area |
| c) After Si RIE | Surface after Silicon Reactive Ion Etching showing roughness |
| d) After Si ALE | Surface after Silicon Atomic Layer Etching showing smoothness |
