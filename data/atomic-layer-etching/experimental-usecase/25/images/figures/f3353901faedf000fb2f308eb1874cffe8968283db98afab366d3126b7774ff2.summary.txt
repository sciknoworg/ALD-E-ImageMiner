The line chart illustrates the thickness changes of WO₃ after exposure to different treatments at 207°C. The red circles represent the thickness after O₂/O₃ treatment, while the blue squares indicate the thickness after BCl₃/HF treatment. The chart shows fluctuations in thickness values across the number of half-cycles.
