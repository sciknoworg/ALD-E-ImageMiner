The chart illustrates the relationship between exposure time and etch rate for two different gases, BCl₃ and HF, at a constant temperature of 207°C. Both gases show an increasing etch rate with increased exposure time, with BCl₃ reaching a plateau around 2.4 Å/cycle and HF reaching approximately 2.6 Å/cycle.
