        "text": "ABSTRACT: The thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$  and W was demonstrated with new \"conversion- fluorination\" and \"oxidation- conversion- fluorination\" etching mechanisms. Both of these mechanisms are based on sequential, self- limiting reactions.  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$  ALE was achieved by a \"conversion- fluorination\" mechanism using an AB exposure sequence with boron trichloride  $(\\mathrm{BCl}_3)$  and hydrogen fluoride (HF).  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  converts the  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$  surface to a  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  layer while forming volatile  $\\mathrm{WO}_x\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  products. Subsequently, HF spontaneously etches the  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  layer producing volatile  $\\mathrm{BF}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  products. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) studies determined that the  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  and HF reactions were self- limiting versus exposure. The  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$  ALE etch rates increased with temperature from 0.55  $\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle at  $128^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  to  $4.19\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle at  $207^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . W served as an etch stop because  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  and HF could not etch the underlying W film. W ALE was performed using a three- step \"oxidation- conversion- fluorination\" mechanism. In this ABC exposure sequence, the W surface is first oxidized to a  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$  layer using  $\\mathrm{O}_2 / \\mathrm{O}_3$ . Subsequently, the  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$  layer is etched with  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  and HF. SE could simultaneously monitor the W and  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$  thicknesses and conversion of W to  $\\mathrm{WO}_3$ . SE measurements showed that the W film thickness decreased linearly with number of ABC reaction cycles. W ALE was shown to be self- limiting with respect to each reaction in the ABC process. The etch rate for W ALE was  $\\sim 2.5\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle at  $207^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . An oxide thickness of  $\\sim 20\\mathrm{\\AA}$  remained after W ALE, but could be removed by sequential  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  and HF exposures without affecting the W layer. These new etching mechanisms will enable the thermal ALE of a variety of additional metal materials including those that have volatile metal fluorides.",
