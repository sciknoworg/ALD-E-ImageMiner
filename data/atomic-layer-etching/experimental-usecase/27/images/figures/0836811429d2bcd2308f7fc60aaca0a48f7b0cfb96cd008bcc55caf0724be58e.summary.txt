The chart illustrates the etch rate (in A/cycle) at different grid voltages (in V), comparing two conditions: one without BCl₃ adsorption and another with BCl₃ adsorption. The etch rate increases with higher grid voltages in both conditions, but the presence of BCl₃ adsorption leads to a significantly higher etch rate.
