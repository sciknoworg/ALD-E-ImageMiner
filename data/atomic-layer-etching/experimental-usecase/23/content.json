        "text": "ABSTRACT: Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of zinc sulfide  $(Z\\mathrm{n}S)$  was demonstrated using sequential exposures of  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  trimethylaluminum (TMA)) and HF (hydrogen fluoride). ZnS is one of the first sulfide materials to be etched using thermal ALE techniques. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) studies were performed on  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  films grown at  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  using atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. These studies revealed that the etch rate during  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALE increased with temperature from 1.4  $\\mathrm{\\AA / }$  cycle at  $225^{\\circ}C$  to 2.1 A/cycle at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALE was also self- limiting at longer TMA and HF exposures. A possible mechanism for  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALE is fluorination and ligand exchange where  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  is fluorinated by HF and then  $\\mathrm{ZnF_2}$  undergoes ligand exchange with  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  to yield  $\\mathrm{Zn(CH_3)_2}$  . Because  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  may also have the ability to convert  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  to  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{S}_3,$  a second possible mechanism for  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALE is ligand exchange/ conversion by TMA together with fluorination by HF. To verify the conversion mechanism, in situ quadruple mass spectrometry (QMS) studies revealed that  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures on initial  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  substrates released  $\\mathrm{Zn(CH_3)_2}$  products, as expected for a conversion reaction. In addition, no  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  products were observed by QMS analysis during HF exposure on the initial  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  substrates. However, after  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures on  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  QMS measurements monitored  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{S}$  from HF exposures, as expected if  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  converts  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  to  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{S}_3$  . These QMS results provide direct evidence for the conversion of  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  to  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{S}_3$  during  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALE. Time- dependent QMS results also revealed that the conversion/ligand- exchange and fluorination reactions were self- limiting. In addition, QMS analysis observed  $\\mathrm{Al}_{x}\\mathrm{F}_{y}(\\mathrm{CH}_{3})_{z}$  dimers and trimers as ligand- exchange products during the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures. Because the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{S}_3$  conversion layer thickness is dependent on  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  exposures, larger  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  pressures over equivalent times led to higher  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  etch rates. In contrast, larger HF pressures over equivalent times had a small effect on the  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  etch rate because HF is able to fluorinate only the converted  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{S}_3$  layer thickness. The  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  etch rate was slightly dependent on the  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALD growth temperature. The  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  etch rate at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  was 1.4, 1.0, and  $0.8\\mathrm{\\AA / }$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALD films grown at 100, 200, and  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. The lower  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  etch rates for the  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALD films grown at higher temperatures were attributed to the larger density and higher sulfur content of  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALD films grown at higher temperatures. The  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  ALD films with a larger density may be more difficult to convert from  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  to  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{S}_3$  during the  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$  reaction. The RMS roughness of the  $\\mathrm{ZnS}$  films was slightly decreased from 7.4 to  $5.9\\mathrm{\\AA}$  after 15 ALE cycles. However, after 30 ALE cycles, the RMS roughness gradually increased with the ALE cycles.",
