For power applications, normally off or enhancement- mode (E- mode) device operation mode is preferred to simplify the design of the circuits and to diminish the power loss during switching and for safety reasons. To date, the E- mode GaN HEMT has been achieved by p- GaN [3], [4], [5], gate- recessed process [6], [7], and cascode approaches [8], [9]. Recently, gate recessed with hybrid ferroelectric charge trap gate stack has been demonstrated with high threshold voltage and high current due to the polarization effect of the ferroelectric layer [10], [11], [12].

        "text": "A normally- off hybrid FEG- HEMT was fabricated using the ALE process for ohmic and gate recess. The ALE process consists of cyclic  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  adsorption modification steps and Ar ion removal steps which results in an etch rate of  $0.347\\mathrm{nm / cycle}$  and with a superior etching morphology of  $\\mathrm{RMS} = 0.281\\mathrm{nm}$  The GaN HEMT fabricated with the ALE process exhibited a high  $\\mathrm{V_{th}}$  of  $5.06\\mathrm{V}$ $\\mathrm{I_{D,MAX}}$  of  $772\\mathrm{mA / mm}$  with low  $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{on}}$  of  $8.57\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}$  and high BV of  $888~\\mathrm{V}.$  Finally, the contact resistance was reduced from  $0.46\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}$  to  $0.15\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}$  and the dynamic  $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{on}}$  of the device was also improved by the ALE process. Thus, this work demonstrates that the ALE process can be applied to the FEG- HEMT fabrication with improved device parameter uniformity and overall device performance.",
