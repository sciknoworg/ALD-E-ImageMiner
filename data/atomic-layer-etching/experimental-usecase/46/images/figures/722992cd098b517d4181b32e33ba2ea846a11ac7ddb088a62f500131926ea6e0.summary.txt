The chart illustrates the equilibrium concentration of various chemical species (TiF4(s), TiF4(g), WO3(s), WF6(g), WO3(g), WF2O2(g)) as a function of temperature. The concentrations of TiF4(s) and TiF4(g) increase with temperature, while those of WO3(s) and WF6(g) decrease. The equilibrium concentration of WO3(g) and WF2O2(g) remains constant at high temperatures.
