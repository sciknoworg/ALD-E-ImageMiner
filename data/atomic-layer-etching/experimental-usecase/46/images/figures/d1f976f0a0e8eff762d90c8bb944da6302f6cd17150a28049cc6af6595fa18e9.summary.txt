The chart illustrates the equilibrium concentrations of various chemical species (gases and solids) as a function of temperature. The species include BF<sub>3(g)</sub>, TiCl<sub>4(g)</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3(s)</sub>, WOCI<sub>4(g)</sub>, WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2(g)</sub>, WO<sub>3(s)</sub>, BCl<sub>3(g)</sub>, AlF<sub>3(s)</sub>, and AlCl<sub>3(g)</sub>. The concentrations of most species remain relatively constant across the temperature range, while some show slight increases.
