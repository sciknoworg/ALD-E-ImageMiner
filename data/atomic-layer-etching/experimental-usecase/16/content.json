The etching process is based on surface modification by fluorocarbon film deposition from  $\\mathrm{Ar / CF_4 / H_2}$  plasma and subsequent activation of etching by Ar ion bombardment from plasma. The study of deposition process showed that varying plasma composition surface kinetics significantly change from deposition to etching. This is associated with the rise of fluorine concentration both in plasma and in deposited fluorocarbon film. Plasma mixture with low  $\\mathrm{CF_4}$  fraction was chosen for modification step of ALE process because it provides low fluorinated film which does not etch  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  and TiN improving selectivity to the potential mask material in etch process. The ALE process shows self- limiting characteristics providing the ALE process window at duration of modification step. The etch rate is  $0.16\\mathrm{nm}$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ ,  $0.20\\mathrm{nm}$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{AlN_x}$  and  $0.11\\mathrm{nm}$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ , which is close to monolayer mode. Relatively short cycle duration provides feasible etch rate in terms of time consumption. The significant selectivity over TiN (more than 20) was achieved allowing employing TiN as mask material for high resolution selective etching.",

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of different materials based on successive stages repeated cyclically demonstrates perfect technological parameters: thickness control, high level of uniformity over the wafer, high level of step coverage, true monolayer mode of growth (no parasitic CVD reactions) [1]. Although the same idea of application cyclical successive multistep process for etching named atomic layer etching (ALE) was proposed decades ago [2], it is still lacks some advantages which, as expected, should be inherent in the atomic- layer nature of the process, such as perfect etch rate control, uniformity over the large wafer, close to unity level of synergy [3]. Although synergy and atomic scale etch rate control achieved in the neutral beam approach [4] were rather good, great efforts are being made to adjust ALE for application in wide aperture plasma source equipment [5]. Currently, variety of materials is studied for the possibility of ALE, and etching selectivity is also under the focus of research.",

The application of the ALE process for etching  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  improves transistor characteristics [6]. The drain current is  $70\\%$  higher in an ALE- made transistor with a gate voltage of  $1\\mathrm{V}$ . Also, the off- state leakage current is almost an order of magnitude less. This is quite a significant improvement in transistor characteristics. ALE of aluminum oxide and nitride can find various applications in microelectronics. Thin films of  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  or  $\\mathrm{AlN_x}$  are often used as interface passivation in high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) [4,7]. Precise etching of these films can be required for producing contacts to 2D electron gas. Another application for thin aluminum- containing films is the insulator in the Josephson junction, which can have various applications such as a very sensitive magnetometer and quantum computing [8,9]. The use of accurate etching technology should improve device characteristics, due to better structure controllability and fewer defects. Thus, realization of ALE of  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ ,  $\\mathrm{AlN_x}$ , and  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ , in the microelectronic industry should enhance device performance.",

The second step is an activation of surface reaction between modified layer and material. The concept of the process is that both steps must be self- limiting. Ideally, there must be no effect of each step alone. Anisotropy of etching and at the same time self- limitation of activation process can be achieved by reaction activation by accelerated particles, which can stimulate a surface reaction but cannot sputter material. The range of process parameters, in which both steps are self- limited and etching occurs due to the interaction of steps, is called the ALE window. The etch rate does not change with variation of the process parameters in the ALE window range. Process in the ALE window produces low damage, resulting in better performance of structures. In fact, not complete saturation one of the steps leads to so called quasi- ALE process [5,10] in which the etch rate increases with the growth of step duration. In plasma etching tools, this occurs due to the non- monoenergetic distribution of ions. So, the smaller incline of the etch rate dependence, the process is closer to ideal ALE regime and process reproducibility is better.",

        "text": "One of possible mechanisms of surface modification which is widely employed on the first step of ALE is polymer film deposition from plasma [5,11]. The formation of polymer films is usually carried out by plasma of fluorocarbon gases (i.e.  $\\mathrm{C_4F_8}$ ) or hydrofluorocarbons (i.e.  $\\mathrm{CHF_3}$ ). The process based on the deposition from  $\\mathrm{CHF_3}$  plasma and subsequent Ar bombardment showed satisfactory anisotropy of  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  etching [5]. Also, according to Ref. [12], the ALE process with  $\\mathrm{CH_4 / C_4F_8}$  and  $\\mathrm{CH_4 / CHF_3}$  mixtures were compared and it was shown that  $\\mathrm{CHF_3}$  based plasma allows achieving ALE process for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  films. The possibility of realizing of  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  ALE process in ion beam support with polymer film deposition from  $\\mathrm{C_4F_8}$  plasma was shown in Ref. [13]. An approach to  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  ALE process in capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) reactor using  $\\mathrm{Ar / CF_3}$  plasma for the surface modification and  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma for the reaction activation showed quite good saturation for deposition and removal steps duration [14], but the increase of surface roughness after etching was rather significant. The important result for understanding the mechanism of the self- limiting ALE process with polymer film deposition was shown in Ref. [15]. The study of  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  ALE with  $\\mathrm{C_4F_8 / Ar}$  plasma for modification and  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma for activation [15] demonstrated that despite not self- limiting deposition process in fluorocarbon plasma, the cyclic ALE process can be saturated. The authors explain that surface reaction between modified film and material is possible only in the limited thickness of the interface between fluorocarbon film and  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  and excessive surface fluorination does not affect the ALE process. Therefore, fluorocarbon plasma is often used to etch silicon compounds due to the formation of silicon fluoride. However, the etch rate per cycle obtained in Refs. [5,15] are on the order of  $1\\mathrm{nm}$ . This shows that the interaction of the reactant with the etched surface occurs to a depth of several monolayers. Although this process is a quasi- ALE process, it will not give the benefits that are expected from a real ALE process. Moreover, cycle duration of the most proposed processes [10,14,15] is more than  $2\\mathrm{min}$  which becomes a major barrier to commercial application, due to the fact that the ALE process could be the longest stage in the IC's production workflow.",

Results showed that even at high fraction of  $\\mathrm{CH_2F_2}$  in plasma mixture concentration of methane family particles are much lower than fluorocarbon family particles.

The etching process is based on surface modification by fluorocarbon film deposition from  $\\mathrm{Ar / CF_4 / H_2}$  plasma and subsequent activation of etching by Ar ion bombardment from plasma. The study of deposition process showed that varying plasma composition surface kinetics significantly change from deposition to etching. This is associated with the rise of fluorine concentration both in plasma and in deposited fluorocarbon film. Plasma mixture with low  $\\mathrm{CF_4}$  fraction was chosen for modification step of ALE process because it provides low fluorinated film which does not etch  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  and TiN improving selectivity to the potential mask material in etch process. The ALE process shows self- limiting characteristics providing the ALE process window at duration of modification step. Activation by applying DC bias in argon plasma allows reduce the degree of dependence of the etching rate on the duration of the activation step. The small value of this slope is consistent with good cycle reproducibility. The etch rate is  $0.16\\mathrm{nm}$  /cycle for  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ ,  $0.20\\mathrm{nm}$  /cycle for  $\\mathrm{AlN_x}$  and  $0.11\\mathrm{nm}$  /cycle for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ , which is close enough to interatomic distance in these materials. Relatively short cycle duration provides feasible etch rate in terms of time. The significant selectivity over TiN (more than 20) was achieved allowing to employ TiN as mask material for high resolution selective etching. The good linearity of etched depth dependence on the number of cycles process implies good reproducibility (from cycle to cycle) and makes it possible to control etch depth with sub nanometer accuracy. The ALE process is adopted to commercial tool compatible with the industry. Without any tool modification moderate uniformity across the wafer consistent with typical values was achieved.",
