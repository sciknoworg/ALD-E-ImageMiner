<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Two-dimensional (2D) metal dichalcogenides like molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) may provide a pathway to high-mobility channel materials that are needed for beyondcomplementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Controlling the thickness of these materials at the atomic level will be a key factor in the future development of MoS 2 devices. In this study, we propose a layer-by-layer removal of MoS 2 using the atomic layer etching (ALET) that is composed of the cyclic processing of chlorine (Cl)-radical adsorption and argon (Ar) + ion-beam desorption. MoS 2 etching was not observed with only the Cl-radical adsorption or low-energy (&lt;20 eV) Ar + ion-beam desorption steps; however, the use of sequential etching that is composed of the Cl-radical adsorption step and a subsequent Ar + ion-beam desorption step resulted in the complete etching of one monolayer of MoS 2 . Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated the removal of one monolayer of MoS 2 with each ALET cycle; therefore, the number of MoS 2 layers could be precisely controlled by using this cyclical etch method. In addition, no noticeable damage or etch residue was observed on the exposed MoS 2 .</p></div>

As the layers of material decrease, the band gap is enhanced from 1.29 to 1.8 eV (a monolayer is due to the quantum confinement effect). At the same time, with a decrease of the number of layers, a tendency from the indirect gap to the direct gap is observed between the conduction band and the valence band.</p><p>MoS 2 has a stable crystal structure, does not react with strong acids, and has an electron mobility that can reach 200 cm 2 V -1 s -1 at room temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> MoS 2 -monolayer field-effect transistors that have been fabricated with hafnium(IV) oxide (HfO 2 ) as the gate dielectric show a current on/off ratio as high as 1 × 10 8 at room temperature and a very low standby-power dissipation; therefore, it can be used in the fabrication of 2D semiconductor nanodevices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The volume of MoS 2 is smaller than that of an Si crystal structure, and the mass of MoS 2 is lighter than the Si crystal structure when it obtains the same electron-mobility effect. At a steady state, the energy consumption is known to be lower than that of traditional Si transistors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Moreover, MoS 2 is investigated as a promising material for hydrogen evolution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> transistors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and sensors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> in addition to flexible electronics due to a high Young's modulus of approximately 33 TPa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> The electronic properties of 2D materials and their application strongly depend on the number of layers; therefore, a simple and efficient method to control thickness is necessary. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is widely investigated regarding the growth of large-area MoS 2 , but currently, it is difficult to control the layers of MoS 2 , especially for a low layer number, with this method. At present, only MoS 2 devices that use a MoS 2 flake obtained by exfoliation have a proven reliability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Instead of the control of MoS 2 layers by growth, MoS 2 layers can be controlled by removing the layers after synthesis. Recently, the use of argon (Ar) plasma to conduct the layer-bylayer etching of MoS 2 has been investigated by Liu et al., and the results showed the possibility of using sputter etching to achieve a monolayer MoS 2 ; however, their etching process resulted in physical damage to the sample surface, as detected by Raman spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Huang et al. controlled the MoS 2 layer thickness by using xenon difluoride (XeF 2 ) etching, which formed volatile etch products such as molybdenum hexafluoride (MoF 6 ) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) without damaging the sample. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Castellanos-Gomez et al. reported the use of a laser thinning technique on a multilayer MoS 2 film to achieve a monolayer, but this method showed drawbacks such as thermal damage to the bottom layer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Thermal-annealing and oxygen-treatment methods have also been reported as approaches that can thin MoS 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> On the basis of an analysis of all of the currently reported techniques, however, the removed MoS 2 depth can only be controlled by etch time, and a precise control of the number of MoS 2 layers at the atomic scale cannot be achieved.</p><p>Previously, in the etching of various semiconducting materials, the atomic layer etching technique (ALET) has shown promising results for next-generation devices due to characteristics such as precise atomic-scale control of the etch depth, extreme uniformity over a large wafer area, and low levels of damage and contamination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> In this research, we propose the ALET as a precise layer-by-layer etching technique for 2D MoS 2 material. Using ALET, we investigated the possibility of removing one monolayer of MoS 2 through the chemical absorption and physical desorption of the cyclic reaction. Also, the possibility of obtaining one monolayer of MoS 2 from a trilayer MoS 2 formation without inducing damage and contamination on the remaining MoS 2 layers was explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL SECTION</head><p>The 2D MoS 2 layers that had been synthesized using the CVD method (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> in Supporting Information) were etched layer by layer using a two-step ALET. First, chlorine radicals that were generated from an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system were adsorbed onto the MoS 2 surface. Then, the chlorinated MoS 2 surface was removed using a low-energy Ar + ion beam.</p><p>During Cl-radical adsorption, ion bombardment was significantly reduced by installing a grounded, metal mesh grid between the ICP source and the substrate. The Cl 2 plasma for adsorption was generated with 63 sccm of Cl 2 and 18 W 13.56 MHz radio frequency (rf) source power at 10 mTorr pressure. For the desorption step, the samples were transferred to a dual-grid Ar + ion-beam system. The process conditions were 70 sccm of Ar, 200 W 13.56 MHz ICP power, and 6.7 mTorr pressure. An extraction grid voltage of between +10 and +100 V was used to accelerate the Ar + ion, while the outside grid of the ionbeam system was grounded. (For schematic diagrams of the ICP systems used for the adsorption of the Cl radical and the Ar + -ion-beam system used to desorb the chemisorbed MoS 2 layer, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>, <ref type="figure">(a</ref>) and (b).) The ion flux and energy distribution of the Ar + ion beam were measured using a quadruple mass spectrometer with an ion energy analyzer (Hiden Analytical Ltd., EQP1000) that was located close to the sample location (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>, <ref type="figure">(b)</ref>).</p><p>The numbers of MoS 2 layers before and after the layer-by-layer etching were estimated using Raman spectroscopy (WITEC 2000, 532 nm wavelength, installed with a grating of 1800 grooves/m and a spectral center of 600 cm -1 ). The thickness was determined by measuring the shift of the Raman peaks at the E 1 2g and A 1g peaks. The thickness of the MoS 2 was also measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, INOVA microscope by Bruker) and a sample patterned by photoresist; the photoresist was removed before the measurement with AFM. The chemical binding states of the MoS 2 surface before and after the Cl-radical adsorption and before and after the Ar + ion desorption were observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo VG, Multilab 2000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The schematic diagram of the atomic layer etching of MoS 2 using the adsorption of Cl radicals and the desorption of Cladsorbed MoS 2 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Since Cl is a better oxidizing agent than S, the adsorbed Cl on the MoS 2 surface weakens the covalent bonding between the outermost electrons in Mo 4d 5 5s 1 and S 3s <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . The bond angle is changed and the bond length is increased by the movement of Mo electrons toward the surface Cl atom; therefore, the adsorption of Cl on MoS 2 not only changes the Mo-S binding energy but also decreases the van der Waals force between the MoS 2 layers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> The weakened Cl-adsorbed MoS 2 top layer was physically desorbed by the ion bombardment from a lowenergy Ar + ion beam during the desorption step. The Ar + ion bombardment not only breaks the Mo-S binding in the layer but also removes the broken MoS-Cl/S-Cl from the MoS 2 surface. This process will continue until all of the broken MoS-Cl/S-Cl species are removed and the next MoS 2 layer is exposed.</p><p>During Cl-radical adsorption, the MoS 2 layer should not be chemically etched by the plasma etching, which involves the synergic effect of Cl-radical adsorption and Cl + ion bombardment. The removal of these reactive Cl + ions is accomplished by the grounded, metal mesh grid that was installed between the ion beam and wafer surface, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the Raman spectra of one monolayer of MoS 2 before and after Cl-radical exposure. The monolayer MoS 2 surface was exposed to the Cl radicals for 2 and 10 min. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, for the pristine MoS 2 , two peaks related to the E 1 2g and A 1g peaks of the MoS 2 crystal were observed at 386.4 cm -1 (inplane vibration mode) and 406.1 cm -1 (out-of-plane vibration mode), respectively; therefore, the gap between the two peaks was about 19.7 cm -1 , indicating the monolayer MoS 2 . The width of the Raman peaks of the monolayer MoS 2 that was measured after the Cl-radical exposures of 2 and 10 min was not changed; therefore, the Cl exposure did not etch the monolayer MoS 2 .</p><p>During the desorption step, the weakened Cl-adsorbed MoS 2 bonds were broken and desorbed by the Ar + ion bombardment. Ion-energy control is critical for the desorption of the Clmodified MoS 2 surface. If the energy is too high, then the unreacted MoS 2 is damaged; conversely, if the ion energy is too low, no amount of material is removed. During the Ar + ion exposure for the desorption step, the energy of the Ar + ion was varied to investigate the Ar + ion-energy window during the desorption step. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> shows the Raman spectra of the monolayer MoS 2 before and after the Ar + ion exposure at different grid voltages, which controls the energy of the Ar + ions bombarding the MoS 2 surface. As shown in the figure, when the MoS 2 was exposed to the Ar + ion source for 2 min with a grid voltage higher than +30 V, no Raman peaks were observed, indicating that the MoS 2 was removed. However, when the MoS 2 was exposed to the Ar + ion beam using a grid voltage of +10 V for 2 and 10 min, no change was observed. This indicates that there was no change to the MoS 2 material when +10 V was used to accelerate the Ar + ion beam. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> shows the Ar + ion-energy distribution that was measured using an ion-energy analyzer during the Ar + ion-desorption step for different grid voltages between +10 and +70 V. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>, the ion energy distribution for +10 V grid voltage showed a nearly monoenergetic Ar + ion beam, with an energy peak at approximately +20 eV (10-25 eV).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the Raman spectra in sequence following the previously described optimized-process step on the monolayer MoS 2 sample. For the Cl-radical adsorption step, 2 min of Clradical exposure time was used, and for the Ar + ion desorption step, 2 min exposure time with +10 V grid voltage was used. As previously shown, no change was detected in the peak width between the pristine and Cl-exposed steps; however, when the Cl-modified MoS 2 was exposed to the Ar + ion-desorption step, no peaks were detected, indicating that the monolayer MoS 2 was completely removed. It is therefore expected that during the Cl-adsorption step, the MoS 2 binding energy is weakened by chlorine adsorbing onto the MoS 2 and is then removed during the desorption step by the controlled Ar + ion energy.</p><p>Controlled thinning of multilayer MoS 2 may be possible using the above-described process. To demonstrate, a trilayer MoS 2 sample was exposed to three cycles of ALET and Raman spectra were collected between each step. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref> show the Raman spectra and the peak distance between the E 1 2g and A 1g peaks, respectively, as the process progresses through each step. It is known that with a decrease of the MoS 2 layer thickness, the peak distance between the E 1 2g and A 1g peaks is decreased to a specific value, depending on the number of MoS 2 layers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>, during the Cl-adsorption step, the peak distance does not change; however, after each Ar + ion-desorption step, the gap   between the E 1 2g and A 1g peaks decreased by a specific value related to monolayer-to-bilayer MoS 2 . (In addition to the CVD MoS 2 , a similar ALET experiment was carried out using trilayer MoS 2 flakes obtained from crystal MoS 2 . The trilayer MoS 2 was etched using the same ALET cycle, and after one ALET cycle, the peak distance decreased to the specific value related to bilayer MoS 2 . See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>.) Also, when the MoS 2 structure is distorted by the physical ion bombardment, the E 2 1u peak near 379 cm -1 is known to appear because of the Raman edge effect that is caused by the distortion of the MoS 2 structure, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> but as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>, no such peak was observed. It can therefore be understood that during each ALET cycle, one monolayer MoS 2 was completely removed without noticeably damaging the exposed MoS 2 underlayer.</p><p>In addition to Raman spectroscopy, the change of the MoS 2 layer during the ALET cycles was measured using AFM. For this measurement, a trilayer MoS 2 film was masked with photoresist and exposed to one and two ALET cycles. The photoresist was removed by acetone, and the step was measured using AFM. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>) and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref> show the AFM data after a single cycle of ALET for the monolayer MoS 2 and two cycles of ALET for the trilayer MoS 2 , respectively. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>, after one ALET cycle, the measured etch step of the MoS 2 was about 0.7 nm, which is a little thicker than the theoretical value of 0.65 nm. Previous investigations have shown that because of the trapping of H 2 O on the SiO 2 substrate, the monolayer MoS 2 thickness may be slightly greater than the theoretical value; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> therefore, we believe that one MoS 2 layer was completely etched after one ALET cycle. After the two cycles of ALET, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>, about 1.52 nm of etch depth, which is close to the thickness of two MoS 2 layers, was observed.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the narrow-scan XPS data of (a) Mo, (b) S, and (c) Cl that were measured during each step of the three cycles of ALET for the trilayer MoS 2 . As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>, the peaks at 229.5 and 232.6 eV that relate to the orbital binding energy of Mo 3d 5/2 and Mo 3d 3/2 were observed after the third Cl-adsorption step; but after the third desorption step, these peaks were removed and distorted. We believe that the remaining peak of Mo after the third Ar + ion-desorption step is related to the diffusion of the Mo into the SiO 2 or the oxidized Mo particle on the SiO 2 , because the peak positions of the remaining Mo after the third Ar + ion-desorption step are  exactly matched with those of the Mo 3d 3/2 (236.3 eV) and Mo 3d 5/2 (232.6 eV) that are related to MoO 3 . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref> shows the two peaks at 162.3 and 165.6 eV that are related to the binding energy of S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 . These peaks are present throughout the third Cl-adsorption step but are not detected after the third Ar + exposure, indicating the complete removal of the third MoS 2 layer. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> In the case of Cl, the large peak at 200.2 eV was only observed after the Cl-adsorption step; this peak was not detected after the Ar + ion-desorption step, indicating that the Cl adsorption on the MoS 2 during the radicaladsorption step was removed during the Ar + ion desorption. From the XPS results, the precise removal of one MoS 2 layer by one ALET cycle from the use of this method is therefore expected.</p><p>In the XPS narrow-scan data of Mo in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>, an additional peak at 227 eV is also shown and it remains until the Cl-adsorption step of the third ALET cycle. We found that this peak is related to the 2D MoS 2 structure, and when the 2D MoS 2 structure is damaged, the peak intensity decreased in addition to the emergence of an additional peak at 236 eV related to Mo 6+ (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). In the case of S, when the MoS 2 is damaged, the S 2p 1/2 peak decreased (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>); however, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>, the peak related to the 2D MoS 2 structure was not removed, and no peak related to the Mo 6+ was observed until the Ar + ion-desorption step of the third ALET cycle. Also, a decrease of the S 2p 1/2 peak was not found until the third ALET cycle. It is therefore believed that by using this ALET, a multilayer MoS 2 can be etched precisely layer-by-layer without noticeably damaging the exposed MoS 2 underlayer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have demonstrated that the thickness of a multilayer MoS 2 can be controlled layer-by-layer using Cl-radical adsorption and Ar + ion desorption in accordance with the ALET. Raman spectra, AFM data, and XPS data suggest that one monolayer of MoS 2 can be etched with one ALET cycle; therefore, the precise control of the etch layer can presumably be achieved using the ALET. Moreover, no Cl residue and no noticeable damage were found on the remaining MoS 2 underlayer after each ALET cycle. We believe that this ALET method can also be applicable when precisely controlling the layers of other 2D materials such as MoSe 2 , WS 2 , and BN; therefore, it can be utilized as a useful engineering tool for controlling the properties of next-generation 2D devices without inducing residue and damage.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
