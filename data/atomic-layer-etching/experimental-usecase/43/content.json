        "text": "We investigated the surface reaction of the thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  film using fluorine (F) radicals and trimethylaluminum (TMA). As a strong fluorination source to replace HF, we used  $\\mathrm{NF_3}$  remote plasma to generate F radicals without spontaneous or anisotropic etching by ion bombardment. The mass was increased by F radicals and decreased by TMA. X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that  $\\mathrm{AlF_3}$  and  $\\mathrm{AlO_xF_y}$  were formed by F radicals, and all  $\\mathrm{AlF_3}$  and a significant portion of  $\\mathrm{AlO_xF_y}$  were removed by TMA.

Based on the saturation behavior, isotropic etching was demonstrated for the  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  film prepared on a trench pattern.

Since the thickness of the fluorinated layer did not increase significantly with increasing temperature, the removal step determined the EPC.",

Accordingly, vertical, anisotropic etching and horizontal, isotropic etching are required to fabricate 3D devices [8]. Reactive ion etching (RIE) is currently a common anisotropic etching technique, and wet etching has been used for isotropic etching. However, wet etching is problematic for nanoscale device fabrication because the surface tension of the liquid causes pattern damage [9]. In addition, it is not easy to integrate with subsequent vacuum processes, and the etch rate needs to be controlled at the atomic level.",

        "text": "The process that can meet all of these requirements is thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) [8,10- 16]. An ALE cycle consists of at least two selflimiting steps, surface modification and removal, separated by purge steps. Therefore, by repeating the ALE cycle, it is possible to precisely etch the desired amount at the atomic level. The ALE process can be divided into plasma ALE and thermal ALE [8,10,15,16]. The main difference between the two is the directionality. Plasma ALE is an anisotropic etching process because it uses ion bombardment to form and remove the modified layer. On the other hand, thermal ALE is an isotropic etching process because chemical reactions form and remove a modified layer. Therefore, thermal ALE attracts much attention as the atomic- level isotropic etching process.",

However, the use of HF presents several problems. HF is difficult to handle, and equipment maintenance is problematic because it is toxic and corrosive.

Therefore, the increase in EPC due to the increase in process temperature was due to the increase in the amount of removal. The byproduct of the reaction of  $\\mathrm{AlF_3}$  with TMA is known as  $\\mathrm{Al_2F_x(CH_3)_y}$ , dimer- type molecules with relatively low vapor pressure. For reference, the vapor pressure of an  $\\mathrm{AlF(CH_3)_2}$  monomer is  $80\\%$  for at  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  [49]. Therefore, high process temperatures are advantageous to enhance the volatility of etching products. It was observed by QCM that the percentage of the fluorinated layer removed by TMA increased with temperature,  $19\\%$  at  $250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  and  $55\\%$  at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  [27], which is similar to the result of the present work. Therefore, the removal step determined the EPC.",
