The line chart illustrates the change in MCPC (measured in ng/(cm²·cycle)) over time for two different conditions: NF₃ remote plasma and NF₃ gas. For NF₃ remote plasma, there's a significant increase in MCPC values as the time progresses, peaking around 3 seconds. In contrast, the NF₃ gas condition shows minimal change throughout the observed time period.
