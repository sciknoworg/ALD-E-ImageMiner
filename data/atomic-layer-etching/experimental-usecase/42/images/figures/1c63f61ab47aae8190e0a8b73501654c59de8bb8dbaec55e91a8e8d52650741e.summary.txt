The chart illustrates the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for three different chemical reactions involving SiCl₄(g) and various fluorides (AlF₃, HfF₄, ZrF₄) as temperature increases from 0°C to 500°C. The reactions show a decrease in ΔG with increasing temperature, indicating that the reactions become more favorable at higher temperatures.
