The flowchart illustrates two processes: fluorination and ligand-exchange. In fluorination, hydrofluoric acid (HF) reacts with water (H₂O), and aluminum trifluoride (AIF₃) is converted to aluminum trichloride (Al(CH₃)₃). In ligand-exchange, AIF₃ is transformed into Al(CH₃)₂F, and the process also includes a mention of etched layer thickness.
