<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is an important technique for the precise isotropic etching of nanostructures. Thermal ALE of many materials can be achieved using a two-step fluorination and ligand-exchange reaction mechanism. Most previous thermal ALE processes have used HF as the fluorination reactant. Alternative fluorination reactants may be needed because HF is a weak nucleophilic fluorination reactant. Stronger fluorination agents may be required for the fluorination of some materials. To demonstrate the usefulness of SF 4 as an alternative to HF, thermal Al 2 O 3 ALE was compared using SF 4 or HF together with Sn(acac) 2 as the metal precursor for ligand exchange. SF 4 and HF were observed to behave similarly as fluorination reactants during Al 2 O 3 ALE. The mass gains during the initial SF 4 and HF exposures on Al 2 O 3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) films at 200 °C were comparable at 35 and 38 ng/cm 2 , respectively, using quartz crystal microbalance measurements. In addition, the etch rates were similar at 0.20 and 0.28 Å/cycle for Al 2 O 3 ALE using SF 4 and HF, respectively, at 200 °C. Thermal VO 2 ALE was also performed for the first time using SF 4 or HF and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants. There was evidence that SF 4 is a stronger fluorination reactant than HF for VO 2 fluorination. The mass gains during the initial SF 4 and HF exposures on VO 2 ALD films were 38 and 20 ng/cm 2 , respectively, at 200 °C. Thermal VO 2 ALE also had a higher etch rate when fluorinating with SF 4 compared with HF. Etch rates of 0.30 and 0.11 Å/cycle were measured for VO 2 ALE using SF 4 and HF, respectively, together with Sn(acac) 2 at 200 °C. Fourier transform infrared experiments were also used to monitor fluorination of the Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 ALD films by SF 4 or HF. FTIR difference spectroscopy was used to observe the increase of Al-F and V-F stretching vibrations and the loss of the Al-O and VO/VO stretching vibrations for Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 , respectively, versus SF 4 or HF exposure at 200 °C. Additional absorbance features after fluorination of the Al 2 O 3 ALD films by SF 4 were consistent with SF x surface species. SF 4 is a useful fluorination agent for thermal ALE processes and can be used as an alternative to HF. In addition, SF 4 may be necessary when fluorination requires a stronger fluorination reactant than HF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Atomic layer etching (ALE) is possible using sequential and self-limiting surface reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> ALE is becoming increasingly important for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> ALE can be viewed as the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ALE can be accomplished using either plasma or thermal methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The first reaction during ALE usually involves surface modification by the adsorption of a reactive species that activates the surface. The second reaction during ALE is a reaction that produces a volatile etch product. In plasma ALE, the second reaction is the removal of the activated layer by sputtering using an energetic ion or neutral species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Plasma ALE leads to anisotropic etching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In thermal ALE, the second reaction is a reaction between a gaseous reactant and the surface layer that produces stable and volatile etching products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Thermal ALE leads to isotropic etching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> During thermal ALE, the main reaction that activates the surface has been fluorination. For example, thermal Al 2 O 3 ALE was initially demonstrated using HF and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The mechanism for thermal Al 2 O 3 ALE is based on fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> HF and Sn(acac) 2 have also been employed as the reactants for HfO 2 and AlN ALE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Other metal precursors such as Al(CH 3 ) 3 , AlCl(CH 3 ) 2 , SiCl 4 , and TiCl 4 have also been effective for the ligand-exchange reaction following fluorination with HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> These reactants have led to Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , and ZrO 2 ALE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> HF and Al(CH 3 ) 3 have also been used for SiO 2 and ZnO ALE using a "conversion-etch" mechanism, where Al(CH 3 ) 3 both is involved in ligand-exchange after fluorination and also converts the surface of the remaining substrate to Al 2 O 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> Although HF has been useful as a fluorination reactant during thermal ALE, HF does have some drawbacks. HF is a highly corrosive gas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> Upon contact with moisture, HF forms hydrofluoric acid, which is also corrosive and toxic. Anhydrous HF is particularly problematic because its vapor pressure at room temperature exceeds atmospheric pressure. HF-pyridine liquid sources of HF are safer because the vapor pressure of HF above the HF-pyridine solution is 90-100 Torr at room temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> However, alternative fluorination reactants to replace HF are desirable because HF is a weak fluorination reactant.</p><p>HF is a nucleophilic fluorination reactant where the fluoride anion serves as the active reaction species. HF is a convenient fluorination reactant that can fluorinate most metal oxides or metal nitrides. HF produces metal fluorides and H 2 O or NH 3 as the reaction products. However, HF is a relatively weak fluorination agent compared with other inorganic nucleophilic fluorination reactants, such as SF 4 . Many electrophilic fluorinating agents also exist in which an electron-deficient fluorine serves as the active reaction species. The most widely used inorganic electrophilic fluorination reactant is F 2 . Another common inorganic electrophilic fluorination reactant is XeF 2 .</p><p>The standard free energy changes, ΔG°, for the fluorination of a variety of materials using HF, SF 4 , F 2 , and XeF 2 are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The ΔG°values are all reported at 200 °C. Most of the ΔG°values are negative except for HF fluorination of ZnS and VO 2 , which have slightly positive ΔG°values. A comparison of the various ΔG°values reveals that SF 4 , F 2 , and XeF 2 have higher negative ΔG°values than HF for all the materials. SF 4 , F 2 , and XeF 2 are stronger fluorination reactants than HF and are all possible alternatives to HF.</p><p>In this paper, SF 4 was examined as an alternative to HF. SF 4 is an effective fluorination reactant for organic carbonyl compounds and metal oxides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> Previous work has also demonstrated that SF 4 can fluorinate γ-Al 2 O 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> The high SF 4 vapor pressure of ∼10 atm at 25 °C also facilitates the implementation of SF 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> However, although SF 4 is considered a safer alternative to HF because SF 4 has a distinct sulfur odor, SF 4 also has issues because hydrolysis of SF 4 can produce HF via SF 4 + H 2 O → SOF 2 + 2HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> SF 4 was used as the fluorination reactant for the thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 . Sn(acac) 2 was used as the metal precursor for the ligand-exchange reaction. Al 2 O 3 ALE was studied to compare SF 4 with the previous results using HF as the fluorination reactant for thermal Al 2 O 3 ALE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> VO 2 ALE was also examined using HF or SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants. SF 4 may be needed as the fluorination agent for thermal VO 2 ALE. Thermochemical calculations indicate that the predicted ΔG°for the fluorination of VO 2 to VF 4 is slightly positive for HF at 200 °C. 17 In contrast, fluorination of VO 2 to VF 4 has a large negative ΔG°using SF 4 at 200 °C. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Thermal VO 2 ALE is reported for the first time in this paper. VO 2 is a semiconductor at room temperature and has a metalinsulator transition around 68 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> This transition is accompanied by a large change in resistivity and optical transmittance. Consequently, VO 2 is a useful material for thermochromic films, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> bolometers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> and switching devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> Thermal VO 2 ALE may be useful to produce thin VO 2 films with low thermal mass and high film stability. A low thermal mass is needed for larger thermal transients when using VO 2 as a thermal sensor. Thin films employed for their metal-insulator transition are also less susceptible to fracture from stress that can result from temperature cycling and structural changes around the metal-insulator transition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION</head><p>II.A. Growth and Etching of Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 Films. The initial Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 films were prepared using Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 ALD. The Al 2 O 3 ALD films were grown using Al(CH 3 ) 3 (trimethylaluminum (TMA)) (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) and DI H 2 O as the reactants at deposition temperatures between 130 and 200 °C. TMA and H 2 O are known to yield amorphous Al 2 O 3 ALD films at these temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> The VO 2 ALD films were deposited using tetrakis(ethylmethylamino) vanadium (TEMAV) (Air Liquide) and DI H 2 O as the reactants at 150 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> TEMAV is a useful vanadium source for VO 2 ALD because vanadium is already in the +4 oxidation state. TEMAV and H 2 O are known to yield vanadium(IV) oxide films. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> TEMAV and H 2 O also yield amorphous VO 2 ALD films at 150 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> ALD films were deposited and etched in a custom-built stainless steel viscous flow reactor. This reactor is similar in design to a previous viscous flow reactor built for quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies of ALD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> However, the flow tube was replaced with a circular puck-shaped chamber to accommodate 8″ wafers. The reactants and the carrier gas flow across the samples in the chamber. The chamber had a 10″ diameter and was equipped with a fast-entry load-lock door for sample loading. The QCM was positioned at the center of this chamber.</p><p>A total N 2 flow of 160 sccm was used as both a purge and inert carrier gas during the reactions and produced a reactor pressure of 1.0 Torr. The N 2 flow was controlled on each precursor line by mass flow controllers (Alicat Scientific). The N 2 flow was uniformly distributed inside the circular puck-shaped chamber using a baffle that served to limit the gas conductance. The reactor was pumped with a dual-stage mechanical pump (Alcatel Adixen Pascal 2010 C2). The pressure was monitored using a capacitance manometer (MKS Baratron 626A) on the reactor. The temperature of the reactor chamber was maintained using heaters regulated with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control.</p><p>The stainless steel bubbler containing the TEMAV was heated to 60-65 °C to increase the vapor pressure. An N 2 flow of ∼20 sccm over the headspace of the TEMAV source was also used to increase the precursor transport. The other growth reactants were maintained at room temperature. All lines were heated to define a temperature gradient between the reactant sources and the reactor. The temperature progressively increased to prevent condensation in the dosing lines in the reactor chamber. Al 2 O 3 ALE and VO 2 ALE were performed using sulfur tetrafluoride (SF 4, &gt;98.5%, SynQuest Laboratories), HF-pyridine (70 wt % HF, Sigma-Aldrich), and tin(II) acetylacetonate (Sn(acac) 2 , 99.9% trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich). SF 4 and HF-pyridine were maintained at room temperature. The Sn(acac) 2 bubbler was heated to around 100 °C to obtain adequate vapor pressure.</p><p>II.B. QCM, XPS, SE, and FTIR Measurements. The reactor chamber was equipped with an in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The QCM was an SC-cut quartz crystal (Maxtek SC-101 gold coated, 6 MHz). The frequency of the QCM was recorded using an Inficon Q-pod quartz crystal monitor. The QCM housing was a modified Inficon Cool Drawer single sensor that used N 2 flow to provide a backside purge on the crystal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> The housing around the crystal was sealed using high temperature silver epoxy (Epo-Tek H21D, Epoxy Technology). The additional N 2 flow from the QCM purge exited downstream from the QCM crystal and raised the reactor pressure to 1.05 Torr when only N 2 was flowing.</p><p>The VO 2 films on Si coupons were analyzed with ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600) after VO 2 ALD to verify the chemical state of the film. The films were loaded into the XPS chamber within 1 h of unloading from the deposition chamber to reduce surface oxidation effects. In addition, the Al 2 O 3 ALD film thicknesses were investigated with ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (J. A. Woollam M-2000) both before and after etching at varying temperatures to determine the temperature dependence of Al 2 O 3 ALE using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants.</p><p>In situ infrared spectroscopy was employed to monitor VO 2 ALD and the fluorination of the Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 ALD films with SF 4 and HF. A description of this reactor, equipped for in situ FTIR transmission spectroscopy, has been presented earlier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> To increase the surface area for higher sensitivity to the surface species, the Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 ALD films were deposited on silicon nanoparticles that were 30-50 nm in diameter (&gt;98%, US Research Nanomaterials). The Si nanoparticles were initially pressed into tungsten grids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> The tungsten grids have an area of 2 × 3 cm 2 and were 50 μm thick and contained 100 grid lines per inch.</p><p>The tungsten grids were resistively heated to 150 °C for VO 2 ALD and 200 °C for SF 4 and HF fluorination of the Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 ALD films. The heating was conducted using a DC power supply (6268B, 20 V/20 A, Hewlett-Packard). The voltage output of the DC power supply was controlled by a PID temperature controller (Love Controls 16B, Dwyer Instruments). The temperature was monitored with a K-type thermocouple. This thermocouple was fixed to the tungsten grid with epoxy (Ceramabond 571, Aremco). The epoxy also electrically isolated the thermocouple from the tungsten grid. The surface and may produce AlF 3 or AlF x O y surface species. AlF 3 is a stable fluoride with a melting temperature of 1290 °C and an extremely low vapor pressure at 200 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> In addition, SF 4 should remove oxygen from Al 2 O 3 through SOF 2 desorption. SOF 2 is the main reaction product from the reaction of SF 4 with metal oxides, H 2 O, or oxygen-containing organic compounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> SF 4 should also remove any possible acac  species on the surface from the previous Sn(acac) 2 exposure. The SF 4 exposure leads to a mass gain ΔM SF 4 = 6.2 ng/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</p><p>Sn(acac) 2 can then react with the fluorinated Al 2 O 3 surface through ligand-exchange to form volatile SnF(acac) and Al(acac) 3 or AlF(acac) 2 species. Al(acac) 3 has a vapor pressure of 3.3 Torr at 150 °C and ∼7 Torr at 200 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> The net result of the Sn(acac) 2 exposure is a mass loss ΔM Sn(acac) 2 = -12.2 ng/cm 2 . The gradual mass reduction during the purge time of 55 s may be attributed to the slow desorption of acac species from the surface. Acac species were observed on Al 2 O 3 surfaces during Al 2 O 3 ALE using HF and Sn(acac) 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> There was also an inverse correlation between the coverage of acac surface species and the Al 2 O 3 etch rate in these previous studies that was consistent with more desorption of acac species at higher substrate temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Assuming that the volatile etch products are Al(acac) 3 , SnF(acac), and SOF 2 , the overall reaction can be described as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Al O 3SF 6Sn(acac) 2Al(acac) 6SnF(acac) 3SOF 2 3 4 2 3 2 + + → + +<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This overall reaction can be divided into the proposed SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 reactions occurring during Al 2 O 3 ALE at steady state: x can be determined by the ΔM Sn(acac) 2 and MCPC values using the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x x (A)Al O 3SF (g) 2AlF SOF (3 )SOF (g) 2 3 4 3 2 2 * + → | * + - (2) x x (B)2AlF SOF 6Sn(acac) (g) 2Al(acac) (g) 6SnF(acac)(g) SOF (g)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">x M M M M ( / M C P C ) 2 / Al O Sn(acac) AlF SOF 2 3 2 3 2 = [ Δ - ]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>x 102.0( 12.2/ 6.0) 2(84.0) /86.1</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= [ - - - ]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The values 84.0, 102.0, and 86.1 are the molecular weights in atomic mass units for AlF</p><p>3 , Al 2 O 3 , and SOF 2 , respectively. Using ΔM Sn(acac) 2 = -12.2 ng/cm 2 and MCPC = -6.0 ng/cm 2 , eq 5 yields x = 0.46. This x value indicates that there are 0.46 SOF 2 * species present on the surface after the SF 4 exposures for every Al 2 O 3 unit etched during one Al 2 O 3 ALE cycle. The MCPC and etch rate during Al 2 O 3 ALE at 200 °C using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 are -6.0 ng/cm 2 and 0.20 Å/cycle, respectively. This removal rate of Al 2 O 3 is equivalent to 3.54 × 10 13 Al 2 O 3 units/cm 2 . This removal rate is only ∼5% of the number of Al 2 O 3 units on the Al 2 O 3 surface. An estimate for the number of Al 2 O 3 units on the Al 2 O 3 surface is obtained from the mass density of 3.0 g/cm 3 for Al 2 O 3 ALD films. This mass density is equivalent to a number density ρ = 1.77 × 10 22 Al 2 O 3 units/cm 3 . ρ 2/3 then provides an estimate for the number of Al 2 O 3 units on the Al 2 O 3 surface of 6.8 × 10 14 Al 2 O 3 units/cm 2 . Based on the x value of 0.46, the SOF 2 * coverage is determined to be 1.63 × 10 13 SOF 2 * species/cm 2 . This SOF 2 * coverage is only about 2.4% of the number of Al 2 O 3 units on the Al 2 O 3 surface.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref> demonstrates the self-limiting nature of the SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 reactions during Al 2 O 3 ALE. Each point represents the average mass change per cycle (MCPC) versus exposure time over 20 reaction cycles. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4a</ref>, the Sn(acac) 2 exposure time was held constant at 2.5 s, and the SF 4 exposure time was varied from 0 to 3 s. The purge time after each reactant exposure was 55 s. This reactant pulse sequence is designated as X-55-2.5-55. Similarly, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4b</ref>, the SF 4 exposure time was held constant at 2.5 s, and the Sn(acac) 2 exposure time was varied between 0 and 2.5 s. This reactant pulse sequence is denoted as 2.5-55-X-55. The MCPC levels off versus exposure time for both SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 . In addition, neither reactant is capable of spontaneously etching the Al 2 O 3 film.</p><p>Other experiments have recently explored the effect of both exposure and pressure on Al 2 O 3 fluorination using HF as the fluorination reactant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref>    given in Table 1: Al 2 O 3 + 3SF 4 → 2AlF 3 + 3SOF 2 . The mass gain can be used to calculate the Al 2 O 3 thickness converted to an AlF 3 thickness by the SF 4 exposure. The mass change ΔM SF 4 = 35.1 ng/cm 2 is consistent with the conversion of ∼1.8 Å of Al 2 O 3 to ∼3.1 Å of AlF 3 . These thicknesses are based on the change in mass of 66 g/mol during Al 2 O 3 conversion to 2AlF 3 , an Al 2 O 3 ALD film density of 2.95 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> from XRR, and an AlF 3 density of 2.88 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> also shows that there is a mass gain ΔM Sn(acac) 2 = 27.5 ng/cm 2 for the first Sn(acac) 2 exposure after the initial SF 4 exposure. Although Sn(acac) 2 can undergo ligand exchange with the fluorinated surface, the net mass gain indicates that acac species are added to the surface during the first Sn(acac) 2 exposure. Subsequently, the SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 exposures for the second and third reaction cycles are evolving to the steady-state etching behavior observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. This nucleation period occurs over approximately six reaction cycles.</p><p>Fluorination of the Al 2 O 3 ALD film with SF 4 and HF was also monitored with in situ FTIR spectroscopy.

These results were obtained using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements with Al 2 O 3 ALD films on Si wafers. A spectroscopic ellipsometer was used to measure film thicknesses both before and after etching. The samples were initially coated with Al 2 O 3 ALD films at 130 °C. The individual samples were then etched for various numbers of cycles at temperatures from 150 to 225 °C prior to the SE measurements. The Al 2 O 3 etch rates increased with temperature. The etch rates were 0.04 Å/cycle at 150 °C, 0.07 Å/cycle at 175 °C, 0.14 Å/cycle at 200 °C, and 0.25 Å/cycle at 225 °C. The etch rate of 0.14 Å/cycle at 200 °C from these SE measurements is less than the etch rate of 0.2 Å/cycle from the QCM analysis in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The SE measurements in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref> provide the trends versus temperature but are not as accurate as the QCM analysis because they are based on only 2-3 data points.</p><p>An Arrhenius plot of these temperature-dependent etch rates yields an activation barrier of 44 kcal/mol. This activation barrier of 44 kcal/mol could result from the temperature dependence of the fluorination reaction. Higher temperatures should produce progressively thicker fluoride layers on Al 2 O 3 . If these fluoride layers are removed during the ligand-exchange reaction, then the Al 2 O 3 etch rates would be expected to be temperature-dependent. The activation barrier may also be associated with the Sn(acac) 2 ligand-exchange reaction. The ligand-exchange reaction may leave acac species on the Al 2 O 3 surface that may block the etching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Removing these acac species would then increase the etching. The thermal desorption of these acac species may produce temperaturedependent Al 2 O 3 etch rates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> III.B. VO 2 ALD Using TEMAV and H 2 O. VO 2 ALD films were grown using TEMAV and H 2 O prior to the VO 2 ALE studies. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref> shows the linear growth of VO 2 ALD films at  150 °C for 125 reaction cycles. Each reaction cycle consisted of two 2 s TEMAV exposures, followed by a 60 s N 2 gas purge, a 3 s H 2 O exposure, and then a 60 s purge. The TEMAV pressure was 25 mTorr. Two exposures of TEMAV were used for every reaction cycle to ensure that the surface reaction reached completion. The H 2 O pressure was 100 mTorr. The mass gain per cycle is 27.4 ng/cm 2 . This mass gain per cycle is consistent with a VO 2 growth rate of 0.63 Å/cycle. This growth rate is based on a film density of 4.36 g/cm 3 measured by XRR. This growth rate is in agreement with the previously reported VO 2 ALD growth rate of 0.67 Å/cycle using TEMAV and H 2 O at 150 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the stoichiometry of the VO 2 films. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref> shows the XPS spectrum in the O 1s and V 2p regions. Curve fittings of the O 1s and V 2p regions are consistent with mostly a VO 2 film with a small component of V 2 O 5 . The percentages were 94.4% VO 2 and 5.6% V 2 O 5 . The peak position was calibrated using the O 1s binding energy set at 530 eV with a single Shirley background over the entire O 1s and V 2p areas. The vanadium(IV) oxide and vanadium(V) oxide V 2p 1/2 -V 2p 3/2 splitting was fixed at 7.33 eV and the 2p 1/2 to 2p 3/2 ratio was fixed at 2:1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52</ref> The growth of the VO 2 ALD films using TEMAV and H 2 O at 150 °C was also investigated using in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The TEMAV exposure was performed at 10 mTorr for 2 s. The H 2 O exposure was defined with a pressure of 100 mTorr for 1 s. A 60 s viscous flow N 2 purge at 1 Torr was employed after each reactant exposure. The FTIR spectra were also recorded after each reactant exposure.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref> shows the FTIR spectra at 150 °C after every 5 cycles of VO 2 ALD using TEMAV and H 2 O for a total of 35 cycles. The spectra shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref> were obtained after the H 2 O exposures. There is a strong and broad absorbance that is centered at approximately 630 cm -1 . This absorbance peak progressively increases with the number of ALD cycles. This absorbance feature is attributed to V-O stretching vibrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54</ref> Earlier infrared vibrational spectroscopy studies of crystalline VO 2 demonstrated that the vibrational spectrum of VO 2 becomes featureless in the metallic state above the metalinsulator transition at 68 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54</ref> In contrast, vibrational features are observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref> for the amorphous VO 2 films at 150 °C. However, evidence of an increase in the background absorbance was observed from 400 to 4000 cm -1 during VO 2 ALD.</p><p>Absorbance from another vibrational mode centered at ∼996 cm -1 also increases mostly during the initial cycles of VO 2 ALD. This absorbance feature is attributed to VO vibrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> The VO vibration is associated with a terminal oxygen that is likely at the surface of the VO 2 ALD film. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> During the later cycles of VO 2 ALD, this absorbance is increasing more slowly because of some VO vibrations in the VO 2 film and because of the increasing background absorbance. The frequency of the VO vibration is also associated with the oxidation state of the vanadium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref> The observation of the VO vibrational feature at ∼996 cm -1 may be an indicator for vanadium in the +4 oxidation state. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref> III.C. VO 2 ALE Using SF 4 or HF and Sn(acac) 2 . Etching of the VO 2 ALD films was performed using SF 4 or HF and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">11</ref> shows the mass change versus time during VO 2 ALE using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants at 200 °C. The reactant exposure sequence was 3-55-3-55. The SF 4 pressure was 500 mTorr. The Sn(acac) 2 pressure was ∼50 mTorr. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">11</ref> reveals that a linear mass loss is observed during VO 2 ALE over 50 cycles. The average MCPC is -13.2 ng/cm 2 for the 50 cycles. Based on a VO 2 ALD film density of 4.36 g/cm 3 from XRR measurements, the etch rate is 0.30 Å/cycle at 200 °C. Additional experiments revealed that the etch rates were in the self-limiting regime for SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 exposures of 3 s.</p><p>An expanded view of three VO 2 ALE cycles from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">11</ref> is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">12</ref>. The SF 4 exposure leads to a mass gain ΔM SF 4 = 9.8 ng/cm 2 . This mass gain is attributed to fluorination of the VO 2 surface to VF 4 or a VO x F y oxyfluoride. VF 4 is a fairly stable metal fluoride with a melting temperature at 325 °C. SF 4 may also leave SOF 2 on the surface similar to  the proposed reactions for Al 2 O 3 ALE using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 . The subsequent Sn(acac) 2 exposure then produces a mass loss ΔM Sn(acac) 2 = -23.1 ng/cm 2 . This mass loss is consistent with Sn(acac) 2 removing the VF 4 surface layer by a ligand-exchange reaction along with any SOF 2 surface species to produce volatile products such as VF 2 (acac) 2 , SnF(acac), and SOF 2 . There is very little information on VF 2 (acac) 2 in the literature. However, VCl 2 (acac) 2 is used in the synthesis of other vanadium compounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57</ref> The Sn(acac) 2 exposure may also lead to SnF(acac) species adsorbed on the VO 2 surface.</p><p>If the volatile etch products are VF 2 (acac) 2 , SnF(acac), and SOF 2 , the overall reaction can be written as</p><p>VO 2SF 2Sn(acac) VF (acac) 2SnF(acac) 2SOF 2 4 2 2 2 2 + + → + + (6) This overall reaction can then be divided into the proposed SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 reactions occurring during VO 2 ALE at steady state x x (A)VO 2SF VF SOF (2 )SOF 2 4 4 2 2 * + → | * + -(7) x x (B)VF SOF 2Sn(acac) VF (acac) 2SnF(acac) SOF VO 2 * shown in eq 7 is the amount of VO 2 that is etched during the ALE reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> x quantifies the amount of SOF 2 * species on the surface after the SF 4 exposure relative to the amount of VO 2 that is etched in one VO 2 ALE cycle. The parameter x can be determined by the ΔM Sn(acac) 2 and MCPC values using the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x M M M M ( / M C P C ) / VO Sn(acac) VO SOF 2 2 2 2 = [ Δ - ]<label>(9)</label></formula><p>x 82.9( 23.1/ 13.2) 126.9 /86.1</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= [ - - - ]<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The values 126.9, 82.9, and 86.1 are the molecular weights for VF 4 , VO 2 , and SOF 2 , respectively. Using ΔM Sn(acac) 2 = -23.1 ng/cm 2 and MCPC = -13.2 ng/cm 2 , eq 10 yields x = 0.21. This x value reveals that there are 0.21 SOF 2 * species present on the surface after the SF 4 exposures for every VO 2 unit etched during one VO 2 ALE cycle.</p><p>The MCPC and etch rate during VO 2 ALE at 200 °C using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 are -13.2 ng/cm 2 and 0.30 Å/cycle, respectively. This removal rate of VO 2 is equivalent to 9.58 × 10 13 VO 2 units/cm 2 . The density of the VO 2 ALD films is 4.36 g/cm 3 from XRR measurements. This density yields an estimate of 1.00 × 10 15 VO 2 units/cm 2 for the number of VO 2 units on the VO 2 surface. The VO 2 removal rate is about 9.6% of the number of VO 2 units on the VO 2 surface. Based on the x value of 0.21, the SOF 2 * coverage is determined to be 2.01 × 10 13 SOF 2 * species/cm 2 . This SOF 2 * coverage is about 2.0% of the number of VO 2 units on the VO 2 surface.</p><p>The mass changes during the SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 exposures decrease slightly as the etching proceeds. However, the MCPC stays nearly constant at -13.2 ng/cm 2 averaged over the 50 cycles in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">11</ref>. The slight decrease in the mass changes during the SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 exposures may result from slow changes in the surface composition. There is a possibility that the Sn(acac) 2 reactant may be able to remove some vanadium species from the VO 2 film as vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac) 2 ). The removal of VO(acac) 2 would change the V/O ratio on the surface and perhaps slowly affect the etch rate.</p><p>III.D. Fluorination of VO 2 Using SF 4 or HF. QCM experiments explored the effect of SF 4 exposure on an initial VO 2 ALD film independent of any acac surface species. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">13</ref> shows the first three VO 2 ALE cycles on an initial VO 2 ALD film using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants. The first SF 4 exposure leads to a mass gain ΔM SF 4 = 38.5 ng/cm 2 at 200 °C. The SF 4 exposure was conducted at 500 mTorr for 3 s. The SF 4 exposure is believed to fluorinate the VO 2 film according to the reaction given in</p><p>Table 1: VO 2 + 2SF 4 → VF 4 + 2SOF 2 . The mass gain can be used to calculate the VO 2 thickness  converted to VF 4 by the SF 4 exposure. The mass change of ΔM SF 4 = 38.5 ng/cm 2 is consistent with the conversion of ∼1.6 Å of VO 2 to ∼3.7 Å of VF 4 . These thicknesses are based on the change in mass of 44 g/mol during VO 2 conversion to VF 4 , a VO 2 ALD film density of 4.36 g/cm 3 from XRR, and a VF 4 density of 2.98 g/cm 3 .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">14</ref> shows additional QCM measurements that compare the mass gain during the fluorination of the initial VO 2 ALD film using either SF 4 or HF. The SF 4 exposure at 500 mTorr leads to a much higher mass gain than the HF exposures at either 60 or 500 mTorr. The mass gain resulting from the SF 4 exposures is 38.5 ng/cm 2 . The mass gain from the HF exposures is 20.5 ng/cm 2 and is independent of the HF pressure. The higher mass gain from the SF 4 exposures probably cannot be explained solely by the presence of SOF 2 * species on the VO 2 surface. The SOF 2 * coverage of 2.01 × 10 13 SOF 2 * species/cm 2 present after the SF 4 exposures during steady state VO 2 ALE using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 is equivalent to a mass of 2.9 ng/cm 2 .</p><p>The ability of the HF to fluorinate the VO 2 ALD film was initially questioned because the ΔG°value for the VO 2 + 4HF → VF 4 + 2H 2 O reaction is positive at ΔG°= +9 kcal. The mass gain with HF exposure suggests that other fluorination reactions may be possible. For example, a subfluoride of vanadium may be formed from the reaction VO 2 + HF → VOF 2 + H 2 O. This reaction has a negative standard free energy value ΔG°= -1.58 kcal/mol at 200 °C.</p><p>To explore further the VO 2 fluorination, in situ FTIR spectroscopy studies were used to monitor the fluorination of VO 2 ALD films with SF 4 and HF at 200 °C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15</ref> displays the fluorination of the VO 2 ALD film using either SF 4 or HF exposures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15a</ref> shows the difference spectra for the fluorination using 10 consecutive SF 4 exposures. Each SF 4 exposure was defined by a pressure of 300 mTorr for 1 s. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15b</ref> shows the difference spectra for the progressive fluorination using 10 consecutive HF exposures. These difference spectra have been displaced for clarity in presentation. Each HF exposure was defined by a pressure of 100 mTorr for 1 s. The reference spectrum for the difference spectra in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15b</ref> was the spectrum of the initial VO 2 ALD film.</p><p>Broad absorbance gains centered at ∼650 and ∼590 cm -1 are observed for both SF 4 and HF exposures, respectively. This absorbance gain is consistent with V-F stretching vibrations. Previous investigations have observed the V-F stretching vibration at 530 cm -1 in VF 4 and at 540 cm -1 in VF 3 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58</ref> The   slightly higher frequencies observed during the fluorination of VO 2 ALD films may be attributed to the presence of oxyfluorides and the higher V-F frequencies in vanadium oxyfluorides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59</ref> In comparison with the results for SF 4 on Al 2 O 3 ALD films displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6a</ref>, no prominent absorbance gains are observed at ∼900 cm -1 or 530-560 cm -1 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15a</ref> that would be consistent with an abundance of SF x surface species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> The absence of these absorbance gains is consistent with the lower x value for VO 2 ALE using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 .</p><p>Another prominent absorbance feature in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15</ref> is the absorbance loss at ∼1000 cm -1 after both SF 4 and HF exposures. The loss of this VO stretching vibration would be expected during fluorination if the VO vibrational modes are primarily on the surface of the VO 2 ALD film. Fluorination with SF 4 also produces a small absorbance gain in the difference spectrum in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15a</ref> at ∼1045 cm -1 . This absorbance gain may again be indicative of vanadium oxyfluorides with atoms bonded to both oxygen and fluorine atoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions can be employed for thermal ALE. HF has been the most common fluorination reactant. However, HF is a fairly weak nucleophilic fluorination reactant. Stronger fluorination reactants may be useful as an alternative to HF. One possible option is SF 4 . The thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 was explored using both SF 4 and HF as fluorination reactants together with Sn(acac) 2 as the metal precursor for ligand-exchange. SF 4 and HF were very comparable as fluorination reactants during Al 2 O 3 ALE. The mass gains during the initial fluorination of Al 2 O 3 ALD films at 200 °C were 35 and 38 ng/cm 2 using SF 4 and HF, respectively. In addition, the etch rates for Al 2 O 3 ALD films using SF 4 and HF, together with Sn(acac) 2 , were 0.20 and 0.28 Å/cycle, respectively, at 200 °C. SF 4 is an effective alternative to HF for Al 2 O 3 thermal ALE.</p><p>SF 4 was also compared to HF for VO 2 ALE. The mass gains during the initial SF 4 and HF exposures on VO 2 ALD films were 38 and 20 ng/cm 2 , respectively. The larger fluorination when using SF 4 also led to higher VO 2 etch rates. Etch rates of 0.30 and 0.11 Å/cycle were measured for VO 2 ALE using SF 4 and HF, respectively, together with Sn(acac) 2 at 200 °C. The more favorable thermochemistry for VO 2 fluorination by SF 4 leads to a larger etch rate.</p><p>Additional FTIR experiments were also conducted to observe the fluorination of the Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 ALD films by SF 4 or HF. These studies revealed that SF 4 and HF were comparable as fluorination reactants. The FTIR difference spectra were used to monitor the growth of Al-F and V-F stretching vibrations and the loss of Al-O and VO stretching vibrations for Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 , respectively, versus SF 4 or HF exposure. The FTIR difference spectra also suggested that S-F stretching vibrations from SF x surface species were present on Al 2 O 3 after SF 4 exposures. SF 4 is a useful fluorination reactant for thermal ALE. SF 4 is also a stronger fluorination reactant that may be needed for etching some materials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>FTIR spectra were recorded at 150 °C during VO 2 ALD and at 200 °C for Al 2 O 3 and VO 2 fluorination. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION III.A. Al 2 O 3 ALE Using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 . Figure 1 displays the mass change versus time during 100 cycles of Al 2 O 3 ALE at 200 °C using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 as the reactants. The SF 4 exposures were performed at 500 mTorr for 2.5 s. The Sn(acac) 2 exposures were conducted at 50 mTorr for 2.5 s. After each reactant exposure, the system was purged with a viscous flow of N 2 gas at 160 sccm for 55 s. This reaction sequence is designated as 2.5-55-2.5-55. The initial Al 2 O 3 film was deposited on the QCM with trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H 2 O as the reactants using 150 Al 2 O 3 ALD cycles. The reaction sequence for Al 2 O 3 ALD was 3-55-3-55. The purge times are longer than usual because of the design and larger volume of the reactor that could accommodate 8″ silicon wafers. The loss of mass versus time is linear in Figure 1. The slight deviations from linearity are attributed to the effect of small temperature deviations on the QCM measurements over the course of the long experiments. The average mass change per cycle (MCPC) over the 100 cycles is -6.0 ng/cm 2 . This MCPC yields an etch rate of 0.20 Å/cycle. The conversion between mass and thickness used an Al 2 O 3 ALD film density of 2.95 g/cm 3 determined by X-ray reflectivity (Bede D1 System). This etch rate for Al 2 O 3 ALE using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 at 200 °C is very comparable with the etch rate for Al 2 O 3 ALE using HF and Sn(acac) 2 at 200 °C. The etch rate for Al 2 O 3 ALE employing HF and Sn(acac) 2 at 200 °C was previously measured to be 0.28 Å/cycle. 5,7 An expanded view of three Al 2 O 3 ALE cycles from Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2.

The asterisks indicate the surface species. The vertical lines separate the various surface species.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><figDesc>These investigations have revealed that Al 2 O 3 fluorination is self-limiting as a function of exposure. The fluoride thickness, y, changes according to dy/dt = k/y where k is a constant that is dependent on HF pressure, k = k 0 P. Integration of this rate equation yields the parabolic expressions y 2 (t) = 2kt or y(t) = (2k 0 Pt) 1/2 . The fluorination kinetics are restricted by the fluoride layer on the Al 2 O 3 surface that acts as a diffusion barrier for further fluorination. The kinetics of Al 2 O 3 fluorination are similar to the kinetics of Si oxidation that have been described by the Deal-Grove model. 42,43 Similar behavior is expected for Al 2 O 3 fluorination using SF 4 as the fluorination reactant.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_11"><figDesc>Figure6ademonstrates that a broad absorbance peak becomes larger at ∼700 cm -1 with increasing SF 4 exposures. This absorbance peak is assigned to an Al-F stretching vibration.<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> An additional absorbance peak is observed at ∼900 cm -1 . A broad shoulder is also present at frequencies between 400 and 600 cm -1 that are less than the frequency of the Al-F stretching vibration. These absorbance features are attributed to the presence of SF x species on the AlF 3 surface. SF 2 stretching vibrations are observed in SF 4 at ∼890 and ∼860 cm -1 .<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> Additional stretching and deformation vibrational modes exist for SF 4 at ∼560 and ∼530 cm -1 .<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> Likewise, a strong symmetric FSO deformation mode has been reported in SOF 2 at ∼530 cm -1 .<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> Figure6aalso shows that a prominent absorbance loss occurs at ∼1000 cm -1 . This absorbance loss is attributed to the reduction of absorbance from Al-O stretching vibrations in Al 2 O 3 .<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> In addition, there is an increase in the background absorbance during SF 4 fluorination. This baseline shift is larger than the progressive loss of Al-O stretching vibrations with increasing SF 4 exposures in Figure6a. The origin of this increasing background absorbance with increasing SF 4 exposures is not understood at this time.For comparison, Figure6bshows difference spectra for 10 HF exposures on the Al 2 O 3 ALD films at 200 °C. These difference spectra have been displayed for clarity in presentation. Each HF exposure was conducted at 100 mTorr for 1 s. The difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectra after each HF exposure from the spectrum recorded for the initial Al 2 O 3 ALD film. These difference spectra are consistent with the progressive fluorination of the Al 2 O 3 ALD film by HF exposures according to the reaction Al 2 O 3 + 6HF → 2AlF 3 + 3H 2 O. The HF exposures may also fluorinate the Al 2 O 3 ALD film to produce oxyfluorides by the reaction Al 2 O 3 + zHF → 2AlO (6-z)/4 F z/2 + (z/2)H 2 O.<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> The absorbance peak from the Al-F stretching vibration in Figure6bis located at ∼700 cm -1 .<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> This absorbance peak progressively becomes larger with increasing HF exposures. A prominent absorbance loss also occurs at ∼1000 cm -1 resulting from the progressive loss of Al-O stretching vibrations from Al 2 O 3 with increasing HF exposure.<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> In contrast to the results for SF 4 , absorbance gains at ∼900 cm -1 and between 400 and 600 cm -1 are not observed for HF fluorination of Al 2 O 3 because there are no SF x surface species. There is also no increase in the background absorbance during HF fluorination.Figure7shows results for the temperature dependence of Al 2 O 3 ALE using SF 4 and Sn(acac) 2 . These results were obtained using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements with Al 2 O 3 ALD films on Si wafers. A spectroscopic ellipsometer was used to measure film thicknesses both before and after etching. The samples were initially coated with Al 2 O 3 ALD films at 130 °C. The individual samples were then etched for various numbers of cycles at temperatures from 150 to 225 °C prior to the SE measurements. The Al 2 O 3 etch rates increased with temperature. The etch rates were 0.04 Å/cycle at 150 °C, 0.07 Å/cycle at 175 °C, 0.14 Å/cycle at 200 °C, and 0.25 Å/cycle at 225 °C. The etch rate of 0.14 Å/cycle at 200 °C from these SE measurements is less than the etch rate of 0.2 Å/cycle from the QCM analysis in Figure1. The SE measurements in Figure7provide the trends versus temperature but are not as accurate as the QCM analysis because they are based on only 2-3 data points.</figDesc><graphic coords="6,324.45,69.17,239.98,194.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
