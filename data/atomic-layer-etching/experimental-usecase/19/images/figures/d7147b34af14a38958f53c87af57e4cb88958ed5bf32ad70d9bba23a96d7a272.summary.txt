The flow diagram illustrates the chemical reactions involved in the etching process of silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). It shows the conversion of AlF<sub>3</sub>/silicate to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/silicate through the use of trimethylaluminum (TMA) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), resulting in the formation of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>).
