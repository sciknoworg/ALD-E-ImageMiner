			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the semiconductors and related industries, the fabrication of nanostructures and nanopatterns has become progressive demand for achieving near-atomic accuracy and selectivity in etching different materials, particularly in ultra-thin gate dielectrics and ultra-thin channels used in field-effect transistors and other nanodevices below 10 nm scale. Atomic layer etching (ALE) is a novel technique for removing thin layers of material using sequential and self-limiting reactions. Different from most ALE processes using plasma-enhanced or other energetic particles-enhanced surface reactions, thermal ALE realizes isotropic atomic-level etch control based on sequential thermal-drive reaction steps that are self-terminating and self-saturating. Thermal ALE can be viewed as the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD), both of which define the atomic layer removal and growth steps required for advanced semiconductor fabrication. In this review, we focus on the concept and basic characteristics of the thermal ALE in comparison with ALD. Several typical thermal ALE mechanisms including fluorination and ligand-exchange, conversion-etch, oxidation and fluorination reactions are intensively introduced. The pros and cons of thermal ALE, plasma ALE, and traditional plasma etching are compared. Some representative materials and their typical thermal ALE processes are summarized. Finally, the outlook and challenges of thermal ALE are addressed.</p></div>

As the reverse process of atomic layer deposition (ALD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the earliest report on atomic layer etching (ALE) technique can be traced back to a U.S. patent in 1988 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Yoder first proposed the concept of ALE to remove a single atomic layer from the surface of synthetic diamond films, which contains fourstep processes: 1. Passing NO 2 to be chemically adsorbed on diamond surface; 2. Cleaning; 3. Impulsing the diamond surface with ions of mixed precious metal and hydrogen; 4. Cleaning. Maki and Ehrlich also contributed to early ALE. In 1989, they introduced Cl 2 to form an atomic-scale passivation layer of GaAs, and then the ArF laser was used to decompose the passivation layer, obtaining self-limiting etching at the atomic level <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Later, Si was etched using F 2 or Cl 2 adsorption on Si and subsequent Ar + plasma bombardment to remove the Si surface adsorption layer with an etching rate of 0.4 Å/cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This processing can be called plasma atomic layer etching (plasma ALE), which mainly consists of two steps: the surface adsorption process and the surface removal process. Plasma chlorination is used to adsorb chloride ions on the surface of the etched materials by chlorine-based chemistry. Removal of the surface utilizes activated ions such as neutral Ar plasma beams <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or Cl 2 plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to bombard the surface of the materials adsorption layer, so as to achieve atomic level etching.</p><p>At the turn of the 21st century, the development of ALE was relatively slow compared to thriving ALD, because of its slow etching rate and long processing time. However, in recent years in order to reduce the size of logic components, the integration of semiconductor devices to sub-10 nm technology nodes requires urgently atomic scale controllability (&lt; 0.5 nm) and selectivity using layer-by-layer etch processes for microelectronics industry. Traditional plasma or wet etching processes fail to meet such harsh demands in such thin-layer architectures, especially high conformality.</p><p>Recently, thermal ALE method was first reported by George's group in the University of Colorado in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Unlike the anisotropic plasma ALE, the thermal ALE is etched isotropically by using thermaldrive sequential and self-limiting reactions and can be regarded as the inverse of ALD process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The combination of ALD and ALE can define the atomic layer growth and removal required for advanced semiconductor fabrication, producing ultrasmooth thin films based on deposit/etch-back methods and conformal etching in high-aspect-ratio structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The etching accuracy reaches atomic-scale dimensions, and a large area of uniform etching surface can be obtained. At the same time, the thermal ALE can also be selectively etched according to the specific radicals or ions process. Because of the above advantages, thermal ALE is triggering tremendous research interests in searching for the most applicable etching materials, processing approach and etching mechanism.</p><p>In this review, we focus on the concept and basic characteristics of the thermal ALE in comparison with ALD. Several typical thermal ALE mechanisms including fluorination and ligand-exchange, conversionetch, oxidation and fluorination reactions are highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of thermal ALE, plasma ALE, and plasma etching are compared. The representative materials and their typical thermal ALE processes are summarized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Concept and reaction mechanisms of thermal ALE</head><p>Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is a technique that uses a sequence of self-limiting reactions for thin film etching. Similar to the concept of layer-by-layer growth of atomic layer deposition (ALD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, thermal ALE leads to the layer-by-layer removal of materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows schematics of one complete thermal ALE and ALD cycle. A typical thermal ALE cycle usually consists of two halfreactions: surface modification (half-reaction A) and surface removal (half-reaction B) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(a)</ref>. Surface modification A refers to that a surface chemisorption layer is formed on the etched surface via precursor vapor self-limiting adsorption, similar to ALD. Surface removal B is that the surface chemisorption layer is converted to volatile etching products by introducing proper precursor, different from ALD. Each thermal ALE cycle can also be divided into four steps, corresponding to the ALD cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> The II and IV steps are velocity-limited evacuation steps, which depend on the residence time of reactants and products in the reaction chamber.</p><p>At the same time, according to the growth rate in ALD (growth per cycle, GPC), the etching rate (or depth) of each cycle can also be defined as EPC (etch per cycle) in thermal ALE. Due to the nature of the self-limiting reaction during thermal ALE, EPC keeps constant, which does not change with the etching process parameters when the etching process parameters such as precursor exposure time or reactant pressure attain certain critical value. Correspondingly, there is also the concept of thermal ALE window in atomic layer etching. However, ALD window is not an essential requirement. For most thermal ALE reported up to date, EPC is evidently temperature-dependent, but in few thermal ALE reactions such as removal of TiN, HfO 2 and TiO 2 , ALE window has been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>For the thermal ALE process, it is the separated half-reaction that helps to remove the interaction between the surface modification A and the surface removal B, control the order of surface reactions, make selflimiting behavior possible, and open the thermal ALE window. That is, "discontinuity" avoids the formation of thick mixed layers and the resulting unrestricted reactivity in continuous plasma etching <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The chemistry of thermal ALE based on sequential fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions has been investigated firstly <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. It can be used to etch several metal oxides, metal nitride, metal fluoride, etc. In order to broaden the choice of etched materials and types, some new strategies in thermal ALE have also been developed based on "conversion-etch" and "oxidation and fluorination reactions" mechanisms to etch SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, TiN <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, WO 3 and metal W <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Next, the representative reaction mechanisms of thermal ALE will be elaborated, respectively. C. Fang et al. Progress in Natural Science: Materials International 28 (2018) 667-675</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the proposed reaction mechanism for thermal ALE Al 2 O 3 thin films using HF and trimethylaluminum (Al(CH 3 ) 3 , TMA) as reactants <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Al 2 O 3 thermal ALE is achieved by sequential, self-limiting reactions of fluorination and ligand-exchange using an AB exposure sequence.

The etched surface becomes very smooth with surface roughness of only 2-3 Å (original RMS (root-mean-square) value of ~5 Å). The schematic for the proposed surface chemistry of thermal ALE Al 2 O 3 is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The overall reaction can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Al 2 O 3 (s) ＋ 6HF (g) + 6Sn(acac) 2 (g)→ 2Al(acac) 3 (g) + 6SnF(acac) (g) + 3H 2 O(g)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>This overall reaction can be separated into Sn(acac) 2 and HF reactions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ligand-exchange A: Al 2 O 3 -2AlF 3 * (s)+ 6Sn(acac) 2 (g)→ Al 2 O 3 -xSnF (acac)* (s) + 2Al(acac) 3 (g) + (6-x)SnF(acac) (g) (5) Fluorination B: Al 2 O 3 -xSnF(acac)* (s) + 6HF (g)→ 2AlF 3 * (s) + xSnF (acac) (g) + 3H 2 O (g)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Whether TMA/HF or Sn(acac) 2 /HF are used as the reactants, the etching process can be divided into four steps: I-fluorination, HF reactant is transferred into the reactor and reacts with Al 2 O 3 surface to form AlF 3 ; II-purge, inert purge gas is introduced to remove excess HF and gaseous by-products such as H 2 O, CH 4 or SnF(acac); III-ligand exchange, TMA or Sn(acac) 2 reactant is introduced and etch happens if ligand-exchange convert AlF 3 surface layer to a stable and volatile reaction product; IV-purge, excess reactant of TMA or Sn(acac) 2 and volatile etch products, such as AlF(CH 3 ) 2, Al(acac) 3 , and SnF(acac), are removed.</p><p>Ligand-exchange reactions during thermal ALE are related to metalexchange transmetalation or redistribution reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref> shows the four-center ring transition state in the ligand-exchange reaction during ALE Al 2 O 3 , which is formed by adjacent metal centers of Al in TMA and Al in AlF 3 through a bridge between F ligand and CH 3 ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Fluorine facilitates the four-center ring transition state because of its ability to form bimetallic bridges <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> illustrates the impact of reactant exposure time and temperature on the sample mass change during thermal ALE Al 2 O 3 thin films using TMA and HF measured by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. At 300 °C, nearly self-limiting etching behavior is observed after 2.0 s TMA exposure when using various TMA exposure time with a 1.0 s HF pulse and constant 30 s N 2 purge pulse in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4 (I-a</ref>). The halfreaction of ligand-exchange tends to be saturated with the etched AlF 3 surface layer of ΔM TMA = -29 ng/cm 2 per cycle. When the TMA pulse and N 2 purge pulse is fixed at 2.0 s and 30 s, respectively, the dependence of △M HF of HF exposure time indicates that the nearly selflimiting adsorption characteristics are confirmed after 1.0 s HF exposure due to the saturated fluorination reaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4 (I-b</ref>)). The AlF 3 layer with about ΔM TMA = 13 ng/cm 2 per cycle is formed, which passivates the underlying Al 2 O 3 film.</p><p>In addition, the sample mass change vs Al 2 O 3 film etching rate is significantly dependent on the reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> (II-b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. With increasing the temperature, the mass loss of ΔM TMA in the TMA half-reaction becomes large obviously, and meanwhile the mass gain of ΔM HF in the HF half-reaction also shows an increasing trend. Considering the two factors, the larger mass loss of ΔM TMA in the TMA half-reaction than mass gain of ΔM HF in the HF half-reaction correspondingly leads to the increase of the etching rate with temperature. The etch rate of Al 2 O 3 is 0.14 Å/cycle at 250 °C, 0.51 Å/cycle at 300 °C, and 0.75 Å/cycle at 325 °C, respectively. These data reveal that only 19% of AlF 3 is removed at 250 °C and about 75% of AlF 3 is etched at 325 °C. At different temperatures, the etching depth is linear with the number of ALE cycles.</p><p>At present, besides Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , AlN, and AlF 3 have been successfully etched using fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Most thermal ALE processes are strongly temperature-dependent, except HfO 2 ALE with an ALE window ranging from 200 °C to 250 °C <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Selectivity in thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , SiO 2 , Si 3 N 4 and TiN based on fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions has been confirmed using Sn(acac) 2 , TMA, Al(CH 3 ) 2 Cl, and SiCl 4 as the metal precursors and HF-pyridine as the fluorination agent, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. HfO 2 can be etched by all of the metal precursors. Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 can be etched by all of the metal precursors except SiCl 4 and TMA. On the contrary, SiO 2 , Si 3 N 4 , and TiN cannot be etched by any of the metal precursors. Selective etching is related to the stability and volatility of possible reaction products. For example, SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 cannot be etched by this process because on one hand neither SiO 2 nor Si 3 N 4 is etched spontaneously by HF in absence of H 2 O <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, on the other hand the Si-F bond is too strong to undergo an effective ligand exchange reaction to generate Si-containing volatiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The negligible etching of TiN is ascribed to either the absence of stable or volatile Ti (III) reaction products or the difficulty of fluorinating Ti (IV) surface species using HF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, on the basis of fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions, George's group has extended the new etching mechanisms of "conversion-etch" such as "conversion-fluorination" and "oxidationconversion-fluorination" so as to etch more materials such as SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, ZnO <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, WO 3 and W <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> by thermal ALE. It will be addressed in next section. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Conversion-etch</head><p>As mentioned above, SiO 2 cannot be etched by fluorination and ligand exchange reactions using TMA and HF reactants at 300 °C with lower reactant pressure of 0.08 Torr <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, nevertheless through the conversion-etch method, thermal ALE SiO 2 thin films have been realized using an AB exposure sequence of TMA and HF at 300 °C with higher precursor pressure of 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0 Torr <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The key    Above all, in the conversion-etch procedure, the etched surface layer is converted to a different material such as Al 2 O 3 by TMA. Al 2 O 3 can easily be fluorinated by HF and removed by ligand-exchange. Therefore, conversion-etch approaches may provide alternative pathways for etching additional materials with volatile fluorides using thermal ALE.</p><p>For example, such conversion-fluorination reactions can also be expected in thermal ALE SnO 2 , In 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4 using TMA and HF, because the TMA reactant converts them into more stable Al 2 O 3 or AlN and volatile organometallic compounds such as Sn(CH 3 ) 2 , In(CH 3 ) 3 , and Si(CH 3 ) 4 with thermochemically favorable ΔG values <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Al 2 O 3 can easily be etched by a variety of fluorine precursors, such as HF and SF 4 , and metal precursors, such as Sn(acac) 2 and TMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. AlN can be etched using sequential HF and Sn(acac) 2 exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Therefore, the conversion-etch mechanism may be very useful in thermal ALE.</p><p>Apart from TMA, BCl 3 can also be used in conversion reactions as the reactant. BCl 3 can turn many metal oxides into B 2 O 3 , which easily forms volatile BF 3 and H 2 O after HF exposures. WO 3 cannot be etched by fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions due to the formation of volatile fluorides causing spontaneous etching, but it could be successfully etched using an AB exposure sequence with BCl 3 and HF as the reactants via thermal ALE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The conversion reaction from WO 3 to B 2 O 3 with BCl 3 is thermodynamically favorable with ΔG°of -7.8 kcal/ mol at 200 °C, producing volatile WO 2 Cl 2 . B 2 O 3 layer on WO 3 surface is formed to impede further reaction of BCl 3 and WO 3 , indicating the selflimiting behavior. Then B 2 O 3 is spontaneously fluorinated and removed with HF to generate volatile BF 3 and H 2 O, while the underlying WO 3 films act as an etch stop because HF does not react with WO 3 based on their positive standard free energy change (ΔG°).</p><p>Parsons's group reported the self-limiting thermal ALE of TiO 2 using WF 6 and BCl 3 based on similar and more complicated conversionfluorination reactions at low temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a higher EPC of ∼0.6 Å/cycle at 170 °C was achieved, twice GPC of ALD TiO 2 . Moreover this ALE process is evidently selective for etching TiO 2 over Al 2 O 3 .</p><p>The above "conversion-fluorination" mechanism of thermal ALE WO 3 using BCl 3 and HF reactants can be further extended to "oxidationconversion-fluorination" mechanism for etching metal W using O 2 /O 3 , BCl 3 and HF, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The main difference between "conversion-fluorination" using AB cycle mode and "oxidation-conversion-fluorination" using ABC cycle mode lies in the introduction of oxygen or ozone, which oxidizes the metal W surface to a WO 3 layer. Then WO 3 layer is etched by BCl 3 and HF with similar reaction procedure. The EPC of WO 3 is temperature-dependent with 0.55 Å/cycle at 128 °C and 4.19 Å/cycle at 207 °C, while the EPC of W is ∼2.5 Å/cycle at 207 °C <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.

They can be converted to B 2 O 3 by BCl 3 and possess volatile metal chlorides and metal oxychlorides. Moreover, in addition to metal W, the oxidation-conversion-fluorination reactions using O 2 /O 3 , BCl 3 and HF can also be applied to etch some metal materials such as Ta, Nb, V, W, Mo, and Cr. Overall, the conversion-etch including "conversion-fluorination" and "oxidation-conversion-fluorination" will be especially useful to enable ALE pathways for metals and metal oxides that have volatile metal fluorides and oxychlorides.</p></div>

Herein, TiO 2 layer as a diffusion barrier prevents further oxidation, showing a self-limiting oxidation reaction. The standard free energy change ΔG°values for the HF reaction with TiO 2 is -6.1 kcal/mol at room temperature, however it becomes positive (ΔG°= +6.1 kcal/ mol) at 250 °C due to the entropic reason, indicating thermodynamically unfavorable <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In fact, under nonstandard conditions, the ΔG value for fluorination reaction may be negative and the etching could be continued in excess of HF vapor because the products of TiF 4 and H 2 O are rapidly evacuated by N 2 purge gas. The EPC of ALE TiN increases from 0.06 Å/cycle at 150 °C to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 °C, which confirms the speculation. Moreover, there exists ALE window for TiN ALE between 250 °C and 350 °C with nearly constant EPC value <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Basic characteristics of thermal ALE</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summaries the advantages and disadvantages of thermal ALE in comparison with plasma ALE and traditional plasma etching processes.</p><p>Herein the plasma etching mainly refers to traditional dry reactive ion etching, which continuously uses chemically reactive plasma to remove the films on wafer surface. It has the advantages of fast etching rate, high throughput, anisotropic etch capability, and wide processing temperature range. However, the principal problem is that continuous plasma etching cannot meet the increasing demands of microelectronics industry on processing accuracy of nanodevices. At present, the technology node of semiconductor processing has approached the critical scale of 10 nm, and the requirements of precision control are less than 0.5 nm. No matter what thermal ALE or plasma ALE has sequential, selflimiting reaction characteristics, they enable the possible applications in atomic-scale etching with high precision. Moreover thermal ALE can avoid the surface lattice damage and charge defects caused by plasma etching with energetic ions, thereby enhancing the reliability of nanodevices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Etched materials by thermal ALE</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> summarizes the typical thermal ALE processes of some representative materials, mainly involving the fluorination and ligandexchange, conversion-etch, and oxidation and fluorination mechanisms with sequential and self-limiting behavior. Since thermal ALE processing appeared in 2015, at present some etching experiments mainly concentrate on oxides, including Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , ZnO, TiO 2 , SiO 2 , WO 3 et al., among which thermal ALE of ZnO <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, TiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, SiO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and WO 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> uses the conversion-fluorination reactions instead of the fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions.</p><p>W Metal is commonly applied in integrated circuits as an interconnect layer and diffusion barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, so W etching processes with atomic-layer dimension are very important in micro-nano device fabrications. One AB sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and one ABC sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> thermal ALE W processes have been reported based on oxidation-fluorination and oxidation-conversion-fluorination reactions, respectively. They both first convert metal W to WO 3 by oxygen or ozone. Similar processing should be applicable to elemental metals such as Mo, Ta and Nb.</p><p>TiN is also a valuable material as a gate electrode for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and a copper diffusion barrier in semiconductor devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Similarly, TiN is first oxidized to form TiO 2 , and then TiO 2 is fluorinated by HF and removed as volatile TiF 4 using oxidation and fluorination reactions. Thermal ALE of AlN can be realized by fluorination and ligand-exchange using HF and Sn (acac) 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It is found that adding H 2 or Ar plasma exposure after each Sn(acac) 2 exposure dramatically increases the AlN EPC form 0.36 Å/ cycle to 1.96 or 0.66 Å/cycle. This enhancement can be ascribed to the removal or desorption of acac surface species limiting the AlN etch rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Finally, AlF 3 ALE is the first example of the thermal ALE of a metal fluoride using Sn(acac) 2 and HF as reactants by yielding SnF and AlF(acac) 2 as volatile reaction products <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In summary, compared to plentiful materials prepared by ALD, now the materials etched by thermal ALE are very limited by actual verification. But it is believed that thermal ALE of more materials with atomic-scale precision will be achieved by designing feasible reaction routes and choosing proper precursors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Prospects and challenges</head><p>Rapid progress is made on the atomic layer etching technology with self-limiting characteristics and atomic-scale control precision, which has great potential applications in microelectronics, optoelectronics, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology fields, especially in semiconductor nanodevices. Ultra-thin gate dielectrics, ultra-thin channels, novel field-effect transistors (FET) architecture such as fin field-effect transistors (FinFET) and Gate-All-Around CMOS require near-atomic scale etching control and selectivity. Compared with the continuous plasma etching developed for more than 30 years, only atomic layer etching can meet such harsh requirements. In several material systems, thermal ALE has been confirmed to obtain controllable and conformal surface etching with sub-nanometer scale, ultra-smooth surface, no damage in high aspect-ratio structures, and possible anisotropic etching with ion or radical enhancement. As an essential counterpart to ALD, ALE and ALD can enable the atomic layer growth and removal steps for advanced semiconductor fabrication, providing new processing capabilities for constructing three-dimensional nanodevices.</p><p>Although thermal ALE has achieved exciting and promising progress recently, compared to extensive and intensive ALD research, thermal ALE is still in an early stage of development. The ALE precursor and materials have yet to be enriched greatly, and the reaction mechanism needs to be further revealed. The low etching rate, long cycling time, low throughput and high cost lead to the difficulty for transferring thermal ALE from research to manufacturing, impeding its commercial applications in industry.</p><p>When IC critical dimension and feature size shrink below 10 nm, the low etching rate of ALE becomes relatively less crucial. The quality and smoothness of etched surface and subsurface, etching fidelity in high aspect-ratio structures, and high materials selectivity become more and more important. This provides an alternative approach for thermal ALE to find the way in future semiconductor manufacturing processes. Above all, at the tipping point the development of thermal ALE is facing tremendous opportunities and challenges ahead. It is believed that emerging thermal ALE could have promising futures and prospects like ALD through continuous efforts of academia and industry.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(b)): (I) surface adsorption; (II) excess reactant evacuation; (III) surface removal and (IV) volatile reaction products evacuation.

The conversion reaction from SiO 2 to Al 2 O 3 is spontaneous because of a large negative value of ΔG. First, SiO 2 is converted to Al 2 O 3 / Al-silicate intermediate after TMA exposure. The following HF exposure can fluorinate Al 2 O 3 /Al-silicate into AlF 3 and SiO x F y . Subsequently, the next TMA exposure can remove AlF 3 and SiO x F y by a ligand exchange transmetalation reactions and then convert additional SiO 2 to Al 2 O 3 again. Continuous TMA and HF reactions result in SiO 2 ALE, and each TMA/HF reaction is self-limiting behavior. The SiO 2 etching rate is dependent on static reactant pressures, such as 0.027, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.31 Å/cycle at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0 Torr, respectively<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.

The conversion reaction (Eq. (8)) from ZnO to Al 2 O 3 is also spontaneous by TMA treatment.
