In this approach, an elevated temperature is required for high synergy ALE due to the low volatility of indium chlorides, and  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  is proved to be suitable. An etch per cycle (EPC) of  $1.1\\mathrm{\\AA}$  and ALE synergy of  $82\\%$  was achieved. Both surface modification and modified surface removal steps exhibited self- limited EPC. The ALE process was developed in a conventional reactive ion etching tool and retains the thin film absolute uniformity on the wafer. ITO was photolithographically patterned on whole wafers using photoresist as an etch mask for the ALE, and clear smoothing of the unmasked areas is observed, which is a characteristic of an ideal ALE process. This confirms that the developed ALE process can be utilized to pattern ITO using conventional photolithography. The demonstrated ITO ALE can be used to fabricate, for example, thin channel or recessed channel transistors, with self- smoothed channels for reduced surface scattering.",

        "text": "Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a degenerate n- type semiconductor with a wide bandgap, making it widely used as a transparent conducting oxide in various applications, such as displays and solar cells, but has not been widely used as an active material in logic applications like transistors. Lately, oxide semiconductors are being studied as emerging materials for back- end- of- line (BEOL) compatible transistors for monolithic 3D integration on complementary metal- oxide- semiconductor (CMOS) logic. Controlling lateral doping, like in Si transistors used in CMOS, is challenging in oxide semiconductors. Even having p- type doping is a challenge as the oxide semiconductors are typically n- type not to even speak of having lateral anisotype homojunctions like in conventional Si CMOS. For these reasons, the high- off state resistance in oxide transistors is commonly provided with a very thin layer of semiconductor forming the channel. The channel is fabricated then either by depositing a thin layer of semiconductor or having a recessed channel where the channel has been thinned down via etching. Examples of oxide transistors having high  $(>10^{6})$  on/off ratios stemming from the thin channel semiconductors are thin  $(\\approx 4.0 - 10\\mathrm{nm})$  channel ITO transistors where the sputtering rate and uniformity are painstakingly finely controlled, atomic layer deposition (ALD) indium oxide channel transistors with very thin $(\\approx 1.0 - 3.5\\mathrm{nm})$  channels (enabled naturally by ALD), and ITO transistors with ultra- thin  $(\\approx 1.0 - 2.0\\mathrm{nm})$  recessed channels wet etched with a dilute acid solution.",

        "text": "While ALD can naturally control the channel thickness quite ideally, the throughput of ALD is inferior to sputtering, and having a recessed channel has been demonstrated to achieve low contact resistivity merely by having a thicker semiconductor layer as the source and drain regions. Therefore, etching a channel recess has some benefits over depositing an ultra- thin channel material. Thus, etching the channel recess is critical for oxide semiconductors in 3D monolithic CMOS integration. We etching the channel recess by dilute acid has been demonstrated, but this is undoubtedly difficult to control due to  $\\frac{\\mathrm{nm}}{\\mathrm{s}}$  scale etch rate and isotropic etch profiles typical in wet etching, which cause unwanted undercut. In addition, while the dilution slows the etch process, it is not self- limited and can still be highly dependent on pattern density due to differences in local density of reactants/reaction products, also known as the loading effect. A digital etch has been demonstrated for amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) nanowire field- effect transistors using sequential  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  plasma treatment and isopropanol rinse to remove the chloride layer, but naturally, a true dry process would be preferred as the described process is extremely slow and mandates taking into account the unavoidable undercut due to the wet etch isotropicity.",

To clarify the system is a conventional dry etch tool and not a dedicated ALE tool. The author used the same system for GaN ALE studies previously,22 and the same model has been used in various ALE studies.23- 25 The tool handles one wafer at a time, and, before the ALE process begins, the wafer is first vacuumed in a load- lock below  $\\mathrm{p} = 4\\times 10^{- 2}$  Torr, then inserted in the main chamber, where the wafer is pumped to vacuum that is lower than  $\\mathrm{p} = 9\\times 10^{- 5}$  Torr. The ALE process is schematically shown in Fig. 1. In Reaction A, the  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  reacts with the surface forming surface metal chlorides and boron oxychlorides (BOCl).  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  gas is known to efficiently bind with surface oxygen and to form stable volatile boron oxychlorides,26 which is commonly exploited when dry etching oxide materials or surface deoxidation in dry etching.26  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  has been used as the surface modification step in realizing oxide ALE,14,16- 18 as the  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  gas can react with oxides to form volatile boron oxychlorides.26 In Purge A, the excess, unreacted  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  is purged out. Then, in Reaction B, the modified surface is removed with low energy Ar ions. The Ar ions provide energy to volatilize the tin and indium surface chlorides on the surface. The oxygen is removed as boron oxychlorides like BOCI,17,26 which is known to be volatile. The thermal energy also contributes in removing the modified surface, and two temperatures: room temperature  $22^{\\circ}C$  and  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  were used in the end for ALE experiments. Finally, in Purge B, the reaction products are removed and the cycle can start again. He backing was used to keep the wafers at the set (platen) temperature. Thermal surface modification with  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  was chosen over plasma modification due to the simplicity of thermal surface modification. Although plasma modification can be faster than thermal due to enhanced plasma reactivity, there are less parameters to optimize in thermal surface modification, namely, no plasma inductively couple power nor RF power at all in Reaction A. An additional issue with plasma surface modification using  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  is the formation of chemically passivating  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  polymers, that the low energy Ar ions in Reaction B would have to punch through.26 Thus, if plasma modification using  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  would be used it might necessitate using higher ion energies due to polymer formation, which could lower the synergy.",

For this, runs with only Reaction A followed by purges were done as well as runs with only Reaction B followed by purges and naturally the whole sequence (Reaction A, Purge A, Reaction B, Purge B). 100 cycles of  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  exposure (Reaction A) followed by Ar purges (Purge A) did not etch the surface but according to ellipsometry increased the thickness by  $3\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . This could be the added thickness due to  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  chemisorption as the van der Walls diameter of a Cl atom is roughly  $3.5\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . The individual Ar ion step (Reaction B) followed by an Ar purge (Purge B) gave an  $\\mathrm{EPC} = 1.26\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , which has a higher EPC than the combined ALE process. So, in fact, at room temperature,  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  actually lowers ITO ALE EPC. This is very likely due to the low volatility of indium chlorides, which have high boiling points. As for the synergy parameter, the higher etch rate with only Reaction B and only Reaction A giving essentially zero EPC compared to the combined ALE cycle (Reaction  $\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B}$ ) gives a synergy parameter of  $\\mathrm{S} = \\frac{0.47\\mathrm{\\AA} - (- 0.03\\mathrm{\\AA} + 1.26\\mathrm{\\AA})}{0.47\\mathrm{\\AA}} \\times 100\\% \\approx - 163\\%$ . To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first reported negative synergy parameter. It is not entirely impossible to imagine an ALE process where the surface modification step (Reaction A) is pulsing one chemical to inhibit the etch rate in Reaction B (Ar milling or other step) to obtain self- limited layer- by- layer ALE. However, in the context of this work, where argon ions are used in Reaction B, the milling without  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  pulsing is so aggressive that there is a risk of damage ITO. Then, the desired application, recessed transistor channels, would surely be impacted detrimentally, for example, by reduced mobility due to damage in the polycrystalline material. The room temperature experiments proved to be unfruitful, but the results are in supplementary material for the enthusiastic reader. Figure  $\\mathrm{S1}^{28}$  shows the saturation curve for Reaction B at room temperature, where no self- limiting EPC is seen.

Interestingly the boiling point of  $\\mathrm{SnCl}_4^{30}$  is below the used process temperature, so it is possible that in the absence of ion bombardment that  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  first attacks tin on the surface and thus enables further, albeit slow, attack to the surface indium and oxygen. Reaction B's milling has an EPC of  $\\beta = 0.11\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . A small but measurable milling rate like this is expected. The combined ALE cycle of Reaction  $\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B}$  has an average  $\\mathrm{EPC} = 1.10\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . Thus, the combined Reaction A and B into the ALE cycle gives a much higher EPC than the individual reactions, indicating high synergy. The ALE  $\\mathrm{EPC} = 1.10\\mathrm{\\AA}$  is in line with other oxide ALE EPCs using  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  and argon removal, where the EPCs are roughly around  $1\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . Here Ar ions are for the first time used for modified surface removal in combination with  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  surface modification for oxide ALE instead of energetic Ar neutrals that have been used in many pioneering oxide ALE studies with  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$ . Ar ions are commonly available in RIE tools and often used in many ALE studies for Reaction B. The synergy parameter value of  $S = 82\\%$  is very high and indicates a quite ideal ALE process.",

The very small slope could probably be mitigated to perfect self- saturation by reducing temperature as at room temperature  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  alone did not cause etching, but this is not worth the effort as lowering temperature from  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  would likely strongly decrease the overall ALE EPC and the synergy due to the low volatility of the indium chlorides.

The EPC is self- limiting even when the  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  dose is increased from 5 to  $20\\mathrm{s}$  so the  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  contributing to ALE has to be chemisorbed to a layer of self- limited thickness.

Similar behavior related to prolonged ion removal step in ALE causing a nonlinear increase in EPC has been found in other works.32,33 As the behavior is only apparent at long ion bombardment times in Reaction B, then the heat accrued during the step might lead to enhanced milling at the ITO top surface. For this reason, Fig. 3(d) also shows the Ar milling only (Reaction B only) EPC as a function of the step time (black squares). Clearly, Ar milling has linear EPC as a function of the ion dose. Therefore, the nonlinear increase in EPC when the ion dose is increased is not related to heat but is unfortunately connected somehow to the surface modification step Reaction A. The increase might be due to the prolonged Ar milling creating a more reactive surface, for example, by amorphizing the surface with increasing dose or increasing the reactive surface area in the angstromscale. However, when the ion dose is kept moderate,  $8 - 15s$  the EPC shows good self- saturation.",

Table I shows the uniformity data of the samples in Fig. 3(b), which are all with same ALE process parameters but with varying cycles. As is the standard in ALD and ALE literature when discussing uniformity the nonuniformity metrics (lower is better) are used. In Table I, both the absolute nonuniformity or standard deviation  $(\\sigma)$  and relative nonuniformity (CV) are given. For the relative nonuniformity, the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the average thickness hence the acronym CV) is used as a metric instead of the often used max- min divided by average as with 30 measurement points the  $\\sigma$  describes the film better than the max- min. The change in uniformity after ALE is the most interesting information in Table I. What jumps out from the data is that for every sample the absolute uniformity is slightly better  $\\sigma$  decreases). If the ALE would only retain the absolute uniformity one would expect that by process variability alone that  $\\Delta \\sigma$  would have both small negative and positive values. The dataset in Table I is not large enough for proper statistical analysis (the ALE treatments are with varying cycles with maximum 2 point with the exact same treatment) but what can be said even from this data is that the absolute uniformity does not degrade, that is, the absolute uniformity is either retained or improved. The relative uniformity on the other hand seems to degrade a bit especially with longer cycle numbers. This is hardly surprising as if the surface features would be perfectly retained and the film would be just thinned, then the relative nonuniformity would naturally increase even in this scenario. From Table I, the ITO ALE etch nonuniformity (ALE effect on relative nonuniformity or  $\\Delta \\mathrm{CV}$  is then  $2\\% \\mathrm{pt}$  in the worst case. Overall, the developed ITO ALE process shows excellent properties as the absolute uniformity is at least retained if not improved. Only very few works34,35 report the ALE effect on uniformity, and if ALE processes are going to be widely adopted there is a need to report uniformity in a standardized fashion and the absolute nonuniformity  $\\sigma$  and relative nonuniformity CV are natural candidates.",

The etched areas have a surface roughness of  $0.49\\mathrm{nm}$  while the unetched areas have a surface roughness of  $0.99\\mathrm{nm}$ . Thus, the developed ALE has a smoothing effect on the etched ITO surface. The 100 cycles reduced surface roughness by  $51\\%$  and a deeper etch would probably reduce this even more. This dramatic roughness reduction is not entirely unexpected, as high synergy ALE processes are expected to show the ALE smoothing effect, and the developed ITO ALE showed a very high synergy of  $82\\%$ . The ALE smoothing effect is well known and manifests also in anisotropic ALE processes and is one of the emerging key benefits of dry etching with ALE. Smoothing of the etched surface is highly desirable when patterning transistor channels as surface roughness causes extra surface scattering, which reduces carrier mobility. A self- smoothing dry etch process brings either extra flexibility or speed to nanofabrication processes, as initially rougher films can be used in nanofabrication to make smooth channels, or processing steps can be reduced for thin films, as there is no need for an additional smoothing step after dry etching as roughness does not increase.",

Room temperature ALE of ITO with the described chemistry proved to have a negative synergy parameter and was deemed unsuccessful for the ITO ALE application. The  $150^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  ALE ITO process gave self- limited EPC for both the surface modification and modified surface removal step. The ALE  $\\mathrm{EPC} = 1.1\\mathrm{\\AA}$  is comparable to other oxide ALE processes using  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$ . The developed ALE process did not increase the absolute nonuniformity of the thin film. The presented ITO ALE was used successfully to etch ITO gratings with a micrometer scale period using standard photolithography and conventional photoresist as an etch mask. This demonstrates the straightforward applicability of the ITO ALE process with soft masks. Self- smoothing by ALE was observed in the etched ITO surfaces, indicating a very ideal ALE process. Dry etch processes, like the demonstrated ITO ALE, that reduce surface roughness while keeping highly anisotropic or vertical sidewalls are extremely useful when patterning very small features. Furthermore, a conventional RIE system was used in the ALE enabling scalable adoption of the process without need for dedicated tools. The low processing temperature, retention of thin film uniformity, photolithographic patterning with standard photoresists as etch masks, anisotropic etch profile, combined with self- smoothing make this ITO ALE process suitable for fabricating recessed channel ITO transistors and other ITO components.",
