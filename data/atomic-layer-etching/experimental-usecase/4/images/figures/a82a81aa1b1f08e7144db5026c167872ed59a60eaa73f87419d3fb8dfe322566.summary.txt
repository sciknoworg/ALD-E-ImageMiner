The chart illustrates the etch per cycle (EPC) and etch depth for different reactions and conditions. It shows that the combined reaction (A+B) has the highest EPC, while individual reactions (A and B) have lower values. The EPC increases with the number of cycles and BCl3 exposure time, and it also increases with Ar plasma exposure time.
