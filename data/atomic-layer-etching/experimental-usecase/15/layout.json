ALE has been studied in the laboratory for more than 25 years. Today, it is being driven by the semiconductor industry as an alternative to continuous etching and is viewed as an essential counterpart to atomic layer deposition. As we enter the era of atomic- scale dimensions, there is need to unify the ALE field through increased effectiveness of collaboration between academia and industry, and to help enable the transition from lab to fab. With this in mind, this article provides defining criteria for ALE, along with clarification of some of the terminology and assumptions of this field. To increase understanding of the process, the mechanistic understanding is described for the silicon ALE case study, including the advantages of plasma- assisted processing. A historical overview spanning more than 25 years is provided for silicon, as well as ALE studies on oxides, III- V compounds, and other materials. Together, these processes encompass a variety of implementations, all following the same ALE principles. While the focus is on directional etching, isotropic ALE is also included. As part of this review, the authors also address the role of power pulsing as a predecessor to ALE and examine the outlook of ALE in the manufacturing of advanced semiconductor devices. © 2015 Author(s).

These devices will require atomic- scale fidelity, where fidelity refers to the degree of matching to the intent of design engineers in shape and composition. Fidelity is dependent on the process variability brought about by manufacturing trillions of transistors per day. Although process variability has always been a constraint to semiconductor manufacturing, margins shrink with each technology generation, and today variability is one of the biggest barriers to future scaling.1,2 Within the next 10 years, acceptable feature size variability is expected to be on the order of 3- 4 atoms of silicon, including contributions from surface imperfections. Surfaces have become a significant fraction of the device size and can appreciably affect device electronic properties.3,4 There is significant impact to device performance from variability (including surface contributions), which increases current leakage and battery power loss and ultimately reduces yield due to failed devices.2 With etching processes increasingly critical to state- of- the- art semiconductor devices, the tight control of etch variability offered by atomic layer etching (ALE) is necessary."

The basic ALE concept, shown in Fig. 1(a), starts with a modification step to form a reactive layer, followed by a removal step to take off only this modified layer. Using ions allows for the directional etching required to form deep, narrow structures. Although ALE has been reported in literature for over 25 years, one of the main challenges in applying the technique in the semiconductor industry has been providing sufficient productivity to make it suitable for cost- sensitive manufacturing environments.5,6 As ALE overcomes these hurdles and moves toward widespread adoption,7 it builds upon established technology and capability of its counterpart of atomic layer deposition (ALD), widely used in the semiconductor industry for depositing thin, conformal films.8- 11"

Continuous etching tends to depend strongly on delivery of one or more species (e.g., neutrals or ions) that drives reaction at the etch front, making them transport- limited. Consequently, process variability may be compromised at all length scales as species fluxes inevitably vary due to depletion and gradients in the reaction chamber, along the wafer, within the die, and in the feature.16 While neutral- or ion- limited regimes can help, they are not always practical and can be a challenge to tune to the appropriate conditions. This difficulty in tuning to optimum process conditions is due to another limitation with continuous processes: the coupling of the transport (or flux) of each species. Generation of ions and neutrals are coupled to the same electron energy distribution.17 Meanwhile, incoming ions and reactant species"

In the 1990s, control was enhanced by adding multiple driving frequencies to decouple, at least partially, plasma density from ion bombardment energy.22 An ongoing effort to reduce variability of process parameters such as pressure, temperature, power, and gas flow has facilitated tool matching.23 In the early 2000s, conditioning chamber walls with in situ wall deposition significantly improved wafer- to- wafer repeatability.24 However, a significant portion of process control still relies on compensation to correct for systematic nonuniformities that are amplified by the coupled transport of ions and neutrals to the wafer surface during continuous processing. Despite widespread usage of balancing competing behaviors, compensation adds cost and complexity to the system, thereby providing a smaller process window. Overall, while process variability in continuous etching has been reduced dramatically over the years,25 it is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to manage around the fundamental limitations especially as we progress to smaller technology nodes."

The earliest report traces back to Yoder in 1988 on ALE of diamond for synthetic diamond films.31 Yoder also studied ALD and cited reciprocity of the processes as his motivation. Another early contribution in 1989 from Maki and Ehrlich reported \"bilayer etching\" of GaAs using chlorine chemisorption.32 Figure 3 shows the number of reports published over the past three decades. A first wave of ALE reports started in the 1990s, with focus on directional ALE as an alternative to RIE.33 Isotropic ALE has also been studied since the early years,34 and compromises about one third of ALE reports. Overall, silicon and GaAs have been the most studied ALE materials, with GaAs predominately in the 1990s when it was the III- V material of focus for replacing silicon. Altogether, ALE has been demonstrated on well over 20 materials including elemental semiconductors, compound semiconductors, insulators, and metals, which are described in Sec. V. Nearly all early references on ALE cite direct connection to ALD, suggesting that the onset of atomic layer etching in the late 1980s originated as a concurrent expansion of work on atomic layer deposition. After a slower pace of publications in the 2000s, there has recently been a resurgence of ALE activity (Fig. 3). Consequently, there is more focused effort to unite the field, as done for ALD over 14 years ago.11 In April 2014, Sematch hosted an inaugural ALE workshop, and the second annual ALE workshop is planned for 2015 in conjunction with the ALD conference in Portland. In addition, ALE has recently become a special topic in conferences and journals, including focus sessions at the 2014 International Symposium on Dry Processing in Japan and at the American Vacuum Society 2014 conference in Baltimore."

We want to clarify some of the terminology and assumptions, since inconsistent naming can be confusing and make literature searches difficult as multiple groups work in different areas of the world unaware of one another. A probable reason for this confusion was that the deposition community was using the acronym ALE for atomic layer epitaxy in the 1990s, when atomic layer etching was first introduced. However, in 2001, the deposition community instead adopted \"ALD.\"11 For consistency and clarity, we follow the lead from deposition and use the simplest analogous term: \"ALE.\" This acronym is intended to encompass a majority of work in our field. Another point of confusion has been the meaning of \"atomic layer\" in ALE. As Puurunen points out for ALD, the term gives the impression that these processes are defined by the amount of material involved in each cycle—an exact monolayer. However, this assumption does not generally hold true even for ALD. Instead, the benefits come from separated self- limiting reactions rather than the exact amount of material removed, as discussed in Sec. III B. The atomic layer name sticks because it resonates with the intention of controlling dimensions with atomic- scale fidelity. We hope the clarifications here will encourage researchers in related areas to join and contribute to the ALE field."

The concept is analogous to ALD [Fig. 1(c)], except that removal occurs in place of a second adsorption step, resulting in layer- by- layer material subtraction instead of addition. The simplest ALE implementation consists of two sequential steps: surface modification (reaction A) and removal (reaction B). Modification forms a thin reactive surface layer with a well- defined thickness that is subsequently more easily removed than the unmodified material. The layer is characterized by a sharp gradient in chemical composition "

In plasma etching, this typically involves each step with distinct chemistry, speciation, and plasma energy composition. The separation is either temporal or spatial, although the time domain is most common using a single chamber with sophisticated process control technology to modulate process parameters such as gas composition, gas flow, pressure, and plasma power. The advantage of separation is that it decouples the generation and transport of ions, electrons, and neutrals, thereby increasing access to desirable species fluxes and their relative ratios, i.e., opens the process window. It has also been suggested that discontinuity avoids the unlimited reactivity that forms the thick mixed layer in continuous plasma etching.22,45 One of the primary advantages of separation is that it facilitates self- limiting reactions."

Self- limiting reactions replace transport- limited reactions of continuous processing, and in this way avoids the associated limitations of continuous etching. The importance of self- limiting behavior is explained in Fig. 5. The near- zero slopes in Figs. 5(a)- 5(c) show that etching for that cycle is effectively complete. As a result, any geometric loading effects—microscopic or macroscopic—that are prevalent in continuous processing are mitigated because the reactions essentially stop. One way to imagine this is as slow reactions catching up to fast reactions once the etching is complete. In contrast, Fig. 5(d) illustrates continuous etching that lacks any self- limitation, which leads to etching strongly dependent on local species fluxes. Even if the continuous process is slowed, by dilution, for example, it is not equivalent to the self- limiting nature of an ALE cycle. Considering Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), we can also conclude that EPC does not factor as an ALE criteria as long as it is finite. It is important to note that even if the reaction has not stopped, i.e., it is not truly self- limiting [Fig. 5(c)], many benefits of self- limiting behavior can be realized with only minor trade- offs compared to continuous processing. This is why we refer to reactions that are as self- limiting as possible, and operating in this quasi- self- limiting regime can be attractive for economic reasons. For instance, ALE can be made faster and thus more cost- efficient by operating in subsaturation mode, in which reactions have slowed down but not completely stopped, an advantage that has been recognized in ALD as well. In summary, ALE is fundamentally less subject to process variability induced by transport limitations when compared to continuous etching, a direct consequence of the extent to which the ALE process is self- limiting."

Versions of these tests have appeared in ALE studies, although not necessarily called out or in context to one another. These tests can help indicate to what degree the ALE process approaches ideal behavior, albeit nonideal conditions may still yield significant benefit. In addition to these tests, ultimately, ALE will be characterized by the benefits on the wafer: features with atomically smooth and flat surfaces, reproducibility of stoichiometry, uniformity across the wafer, etching without loading (pattern- density independence), low- damage to remaining material, and etch selectivity to other materials."

Ideally, there is no etching during the modification step (i.e., reaction A). Similarly, there should be no etching beyond the surface modified layer in reaction B. In practice, each step may result in removal of some material but the conditions should be chosen such that this etching is small compared to that achieved by combining the steps into an ALE cycle. We will discuss how to minimize nonideal behavior further when we consider the case example of silicon ALE in Sec. IV. The second test is the saturation curve, and its importance was discussed in Sec. III B and shown in Fig. 5. They are used to determine the degree of self- limiting behavior for the chosen conditions."

Region I represents incomplete etching for low removal energy, while region III represents over- etching for high removal energy (e.g., sputter). Region II represents the \"ALE window\" with complete removal independent of energy, indicative of self- limiting behavior. The window is analogous to the so- called ALD window where energy is typically denoted by substrate temperature. The window exists because the energy barrier to remove the modified layer has been lowered relative to the unmodified layer. Therefore, the width depends on the specific reactant- target- energy combination, and is a measure of how much the modification step lowers the energy barrier to removal. An additional \"selectivity window\" can be identified if the window for one material is offset from another. Overall, these tests are valuable in characterizing ALE processes and offering a framework to understanding how different processes depend on the most important parameters in ALE: time and energy."

Although the ion neutralizes before it reaches the surface, we still refer to the particle as an ion for simplicity.79 Also, Ar does not generally remain in the silicon substrate, as most of the Ar recoils or reflects back into vacuum after impact.36 All in all, the primary role of the "

In fact, in early ALE studies, self- limited half a monolayer EPC was observed in ion- assisted removal of chlorinated silicon surface.39,88 The reason for the different EPC values in silicon ALE is not entirely understood. However, it serves to show that EPC is not a defining factor in ALE even in relatively ideal circumstances, and that monolayer removal is not a universal expectation. In addition to different pathways, other effects such as steric hindrance and initial surface roughness will also factor into the amount etched per cycle.9"

Examples of two secondary reactions are discussed in this section: etching during chlorination and pure sputtering during removal. Both phenomena do not saturate in time and so eliminating them is important for self- limited behavior. The synergy test is designed to measure contributions from these two nonsynergistic sources. To clarify, ion- neutral synergy is desirable in ALE, similar to the synergy encountered by Coburn and Winters in their classic 1978 experiments.15 The difference is that in ALE the ion and neutral reactions are separated and not simultaneous."

Chemical etching during chlorination can compromise process results by undercutting the mask or increasing surface roughness.33,99 Chemical etching is less problematic in thermal chlorination because chlorine molecules do not spontaneously etch silicon. In general, chemical etching can be suppressed by cooling the substrate, based on the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence of reactions.33 However, plasma chlorination considerably increases the possibility of background etching due to the presence of radicals, ions, photons, metastables, and low energy electrons, all of which can potentially induce etching.13 Photons may play a role, as they are known to induce subthreshold etching as described by Shin et al.100 Low energy ions should not etch at subthreshold energies "

For example, Park et al. studied ALE on the gate recess process in InP high electron mobility transistor. The stoichiometry of InP remained similar to the original film, indicating no preferential removal of indium or phosphorous, in contrast to continuous etching.68,69 Similar benefit was found for other III- V materials, including tertiary compounds such as InAlAs.50 Researchers have concluded minimal damage in directional ALE of III- Vs based also on electrical characteristics similar to the unetched surface.50,56- 58"

This is followed by removal of the oxidized layer by submerging the wafer into a wet acid bath (e.g., HCl solution) (reaction B). A wide variety of oxidizing methods have been used.

New metal materials are potential candidates for emerging memory devices, such as MRAM. Etching metals using continuous etching is often itself challenging, because many metals form nonvolatile etch byproducts that redeposit on sidewalls rendering the device useless. If ALE can address this challenge it will have a big impact on enabling metal integration into devices.117 However, only a few metal ALE reports have been published. In 2000, Kuo and Lee reported a two- step self- limiting process for copper (Cu) by chlorinating the surface, followed by immersion into dilute HCl bath "

The data indicates that sputtering caused damage to the top layer of carbon atoms and partially embedded it into the zinc lattice. The damaged layer was subsequently removed by an acid treatment that washed away the layer along with zinc.41,123 Graphene was also studied with directional ALE, using oxygen atoms from plasma to form the reactive layer on the uppermost graphene layer, followed by an Ar neutral beam, removing one monolayer of graphene in each cycle.92,93 Besides graphene, directional ALE has also been successful on other potential 2D supermaterials, such as transition- metal dichalcogenide semiconductor "

In 1991, an electrochemistry- based ALE process was reported for the compound semiconductor cadmium telluride (CdTe) used in electro- optics.124 This approach is an example of the \"extraction\" category as the oxidation actually removes specific elements in the compound (e.g., Cd in CdTe) in the top material layer. Other compounds such as GaAs could also work with this method. Another example outside the semiconductor industry was reported in 2009 for ALE of gold- based materials (e.g., AuSn) used in light- emitting diodes.125 For binary etching of compounds, each element of the component was preferentially extracted in only the topmost layer using separate wet etchants, leaving an atomic layer of the other element to be removed in the subsequent step, as shown in Fig. 9(d)."

Ultimately, ALE may not be needed in every application: each application will drive its own set of requirements and trade- offs between throughput, cost, and performance."

As dimensions shrink, properties of surfaces and subsurface layers are becoming increasingly important, especially for alternative materials such as III- V compound semiconductors. This has implications for the ALE roadmap, as novel devices and interconnect schemes drive development of ALE processes for materials other than silicon. While surface quality is usually given the most attention in ALE, other benefits, such as reduced feature loading in high aspect ratio etching applications and higher selectivity, are often just as desirable and warrant further attention. All of this is a great challenge and opportunity for the etch community. A challenge, because much of the future of Moore's law and the semiconductor industry will depend on the progress of this endeavor. An opportunity, because etching may finally, truly shed the stigma of being a \"black box.\"133,134"
