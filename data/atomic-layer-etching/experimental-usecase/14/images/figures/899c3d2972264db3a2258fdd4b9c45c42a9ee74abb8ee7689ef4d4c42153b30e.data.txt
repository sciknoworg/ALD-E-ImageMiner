| Process Step | Description |
|---|---|
| SiN | Initial state of silicon nitride layer |
| Hydrofluorocarbon-based plasma | Exposure to plasma to modify surface |
| (NH4)2SiF6 | Reaction with ammonium hexafluorosilicate |
| Self-limiting | Process stops due to self-limiting effect |
| IR annealing | Infrared annealing to further modify surface |
| Desorption | Removal of adsorbed species |
