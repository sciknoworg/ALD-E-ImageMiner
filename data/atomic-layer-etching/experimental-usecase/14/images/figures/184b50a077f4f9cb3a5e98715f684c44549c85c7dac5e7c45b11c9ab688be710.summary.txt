The diagram illustrates a sequence of chemical reactions involving silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and silicon (Si). Initially, the structure remains unchanged. In step B, hydrofluoric acid (HF) replaces Al2O3 with AlF3. Finally, in step C, trimethylaluminum (Al(CH3)3) reacts with SiO2, leading to partial etching of SiO2 and the formation of new compounds.
