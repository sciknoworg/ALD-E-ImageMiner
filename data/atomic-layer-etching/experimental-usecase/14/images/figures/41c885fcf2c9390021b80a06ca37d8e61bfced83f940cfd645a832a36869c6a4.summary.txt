The image illustrates two half-reactions involving ZnO films and organic molecules. Half-reaction A shows the interaction between a ZnO film and a molecule with a carbonyl group, leading to a chemical transformation. Half-reaction B depicts the reaction of a ZnO film with an oxygen plasma, resulting in the formation of CO2, CO, and H2O.
