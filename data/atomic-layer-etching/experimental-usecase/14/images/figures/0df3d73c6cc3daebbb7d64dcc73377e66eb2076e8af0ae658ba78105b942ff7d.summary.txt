The chart illustrates the film thickness of various materials (TiN, ZrO₂, SiO₂, Si₃N₄, HfO₂, Al₂O₃) over different numbers of cycles under two conditions: TMA at 300°C and DMAC at 250°C. The thickness of all materials decreases with increasing number of cycles, except for TiN which remains constant.
