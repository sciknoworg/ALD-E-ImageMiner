Two process sequences representing two different methods of ALEt are described, followed by several examples where ALEt can be an enabling process technology in the semiconductor industry. The authors believe that there needs to be an increased understanding of surface functionalization, modification and chemistry- based material removal. We are confident that this review article will allow for increased scientific and technological solutions for enabling ALEt. "

It was earlier believed that atomic layer etching was not manufacturable due to its slow material removal and relatively large thickness of the film stacks to be removed.

We will start by outlining two potential paths toward layer- by- layer removal. The first approach is schematically shown in Figure 1a- 1d. Figure 1a shows a starting substrate where the surface layer is modified using either neutrals, radicals or molecules as represented in Figure 1b. Figure 1c shows the surface layer being bombarded by energetic ions or neutrals to break the bonds of the surface layer of atoms and resulting in the release of the volatile by- products, Figure 1d. The idealized sequence described in Figure 1a- 1d enables formation of an anisotropic atomic layer removal of material. Several reports are present in the literature, where variations of the idealized flow have been successfully demonstrated. A requirement for this flow, and hence somewhat of a limitation, is that the modified surface layer released during the process in Figure 1c should be a stable volatile by- product so that it can be efficiently pumped out of the process chamber. For example, Metzler et al. have reported such a mechanism to remove an atomic layer of "

In a finFET, the body of the transistor consists of a raised fin, allowing the gate to wrap around three sides of the channel. Forming a finFET channel for the gate to wrap around requires a highly vertical fin etch with selectivity to a hardmask. For Si transistors, it is critical in this step to minimize etch damage to the fin, as surface defects and roughness negatively impact carrier mobility and device performance. This damage in a plasma etch is often the result of charging, attack of reactive radicals into the channel, and damage from vacuum ultra violet (VUV) radiation. Wet cleaning for removal of the damaged layer becomes increasingly difficult as fins become more fragile and at tighter pitch. One option for reducing etch damage to the channel would be to use a gentle, anisotropic ALEt process for"

A key barrier is chemically activating the silicon surface sufficiently so that it can be volatilized by another chemical species or thermal desorption, while not driving the activating chemical deeper into the Si causing more damage and losing atomic level control.

The channel of a GAA transistor consists of a thin wire around which the gate metal wraps completely on all sides, Figure 4. In order for the GAA gate to provide effective control of the channel at short gate length, the width of the wire channel can be only a few nanometers,11 making atomic level control of the etch to define the channel a critical aspect of the process.

The four colors in these tiles represent four different material types (these can be different dielectrics, a- C, SiCOH, SiN, etc...). The goal for this multi- color selectivity challenge would be to remove one color tile with extreme selectivity to the three remaining tiles. One could also envision a second sequence where a different color tile may need to be removed with selectivity to the remaining tiles. Selective surface functionalization of the \"blue\" tile (for example) would be a key element for success with such a selective process. In addition to selectivity, the complete removal of etched material and retention of sharp corners are of equal importance. No current plasma etch based process can, in our estimation, meet such stringent process requirements. Wet etch removal of similar materials with high selectivity to one another also appears to be challenging. We believe with careful surface functionalization, surface adsorption and proper combination of ligands, such highly demanding process goals can be achieved."

This is followed by a ligand exposure (Figure 6c) and a thermally assisted removal of metal- ligand by- product, Figure 6d. By precisely controlling the depth of top layer conversion, preventing intermixing of the metal and dielectric films and the right chemistry, one can envision an anisotropic and almost infinite selectivity process."

With increased scaling, we believe that ALEt has the potential to become a critical process tool. As a closing thought, we compare ALEt publications status with its conceptually related counterpart atomic layer deposition (ALD) which made its formal debut nearly two decades ago, Figure 8. While rich chemistry has been developed for ALD in the past decade, in both precursor and process development areas, there is a significant opportunity for ALEt to learn from its counterpart. We hope that this industry perspective will trigger an exponential growth in scientific and technological output like ALD witnessed in mid- 1990s."
