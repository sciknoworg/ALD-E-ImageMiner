This is achieved via a multistep process in which two key phases, surface modification followed by surface removal, limit the etching of material to individual atomic layers per cycle. ALE is of great interest for traditional semiconductors and has seen an influx in development over recent years. $^{1 - 6}$  As technology nodes increasingly demand sub- 10 nm fidelity restraints, atomic- scale precision becomes a necessity. $^{6,7}$  The reactant of choice for directional ALE of Si has primarily been  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  followed by Ar bombardment, with high directionality and minimal damage demonstrated. $^{6 - 11}$  Compound III- V materials present a more complex challenge to ALE development, compared to single element materials. Again,  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  has been the reactant of choice in most directional ALE studies on materials such as  $\\mathrm{GaAs}^{12,13}$  and  $\\mathrm{GaN}^{3,4}$  Based on the electrical characterization of surfaces exposed to ALE, several studies have shown minimal damage for both Si and III- V materials when compared to reactive ion etching. $^{5,14}$  More recently, HBr has been reported as a suitable reactant in directional ALE of both GaN and Ge, $^{5,15}$  demonstrating a less volatile response in comparison to  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$ . Here, HBr was speculated to produce a thinner reaction layer than  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  due to the larger diameter of HBr atoms while also producing less volatile etch products such as  $\\mathrm{GaBr}_3$ . $^{5}$  A particular advantage of this lower volatility is reduced sidewall etching, observed for a HBr process when compared with  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$ . $^{5}$",

Results showed an increase in surface Rq while etching into the AlGaN layer (from 0.7 to  $1.1\\mathrm{nm}$  caused by what appears to be micromasking effects. These surface peaks measured around  $5\\mathrm{nm}$  in height and dissipate gradually as the etch moves into the GaN layer, suggesting the effect to be AlGaN specific. The same micromasking of AlGaN was also observed by Ohba et al. for a  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  based ALE process on GaN/AlGaN. Based on XPS analysis of surfaces after etching, they proposed that the micromasking was caused by the formation of nonvolatile ALO. A solution was found through the introduction of  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  to the chamber, acting as a scavenger to form BClO.26 After this modification, the surface Rq of their AlGaN layers returned to pre- etch levels. We, therefore, expect that similar optimization of our process, with the inclusion of  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  to Reaction A (HBr surface modification step), would remedy the increased AlGaN roughness. Without this modification, the observed surface roughness for our process shown here resulted in a Rq increase of  $0.4\\mathrm{nm}$  after 100 cycles (AlGaN layer) and  $0.2\\mathrm{nm}$  after 400 cycles (GaN layer) when compared to initial starting values. While fair comparisons of roughness data between reported literature are difficult, due to variations in substrates, etch processes, and measurement procedures such as scan size, an increase in surface Rq of  $0.6\\mathrm{nm}$  was reported for ALE of GaN after 200 cycles using  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$ .3",
