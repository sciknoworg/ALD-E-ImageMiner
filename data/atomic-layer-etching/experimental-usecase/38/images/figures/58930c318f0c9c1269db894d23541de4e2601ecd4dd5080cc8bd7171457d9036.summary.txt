The chart illustrates the thickness of various layers in a semiconductor structure, starting with an in-situ SiN layer at 10 nm, followed by a GaN layer at 2 nm, an AlGaN layer at 20 nm, an AlN layer at 1 nm, another GaN layer at 300 nm, a C-doped buffer layer at 3900 nm, and finally a silicon substrate.
