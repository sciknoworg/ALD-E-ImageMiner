        "text": "ABSTRACT: Atomic layer etching (ALE) provides Angstrom- level control over material removal and holds potential for addressing the challenges in nanomanufacturing faced by conventional etching techniques. Recent research has led to the development of two main classes of ALE: ion- driven plasma processes yielding anisotropic (or directional) etch profiles and thermally driven processes for isotropic material removal. In this work, we extend the possibilities to obtain isotropic etching by introducing a plasma- based ALE process for  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  which is radical- driven and utilizes acetylacetone (Hacac) and  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma as reactants. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements indicate self- limiting half- reactions with etch rates ranging from 0.5 to  $1.3\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle at temperatures between 100 and  $250^{\\circ}C$  The ALE process was demonstrated on planar and three- dimensional substrates consisting of a regular array of semiconductor nanowires (NWs) conformally covered using atomic layer deposition of  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  Transmission electron microscopy studies conducted on the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  - covered NWs before and after ALE proved the isotropic nature and the damage- free characteristics of the process. In situ infrared spectroscopy measurements were used to elucidate the self- limiting nature of the ALE half- reactions and the reaction mechanism. During the Hacac etching reaction that is assumed to produce  $\\mathrm{Zn(acac)_2}$  carbonaceous species adsorbed on the  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  surface are suggested as the cause of the self- limiting behavior. The subsequent  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma step resets the surface for the next ALE cycle. High etch selectivities  $(\\sim 80:1)$  over  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  were demonstrated. Preliminary results indicate that the etching process can be extended to other oxides such as  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$",

Aggressive scaling of silicon- based devices has been enabled by the availability of advanced processing techniques. Here, an example is the so- called self- aligned multiple patterning that allows to pattern structures far below the limits of immersion lithography, and it is currently implemented during flash memory and multigate [fin field- effect transistor (finFET)] fabrication. Looking further ahead, atomic- scale processing will become a necessity in order to enable technological leaps forward such as in the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. For example, the development of advanced computing methods such as neuromorphic and quantum computing requires to process atomically thin and other exotic materials into complex architectures.

When comparing the plasma- based ALE process presented in this work with the complementary thermal ALE process of  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  using TMA and  $\\mathrm{HF}$ , several differences can be highlighted.

In the case of thermal ALE, no  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  etching was observed for temperatures below  $220^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ; conversely, the plasma- based ALE can be used to etch  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  at temperatures as low as  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ .
