The chart shows the thickness of ZnO over different numbers of cycles for three conditions: Hacac + O₂ gas, Hacac + O₂ plasma, and O₂ plasma. The thickness remains constant at approximately 590 Å for Hacac + O₂ gas and O₂ plasma across all cycles, while it decreases significantly for Hacac + O₂ plasma.
