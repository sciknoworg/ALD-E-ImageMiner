The image illustrates two half-reactions involving ZnO films and a chemical compound. Half-reaction A shows the interaction between the compound and the ZnO film, leading to a chemical transformation. Half-reaction B depicts the effect of O2 plasma on the same compound and ZnO film, resulting in the production of CO2, CO, and H2O.
