Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is currently being developed to isotropically etch material for future applications. In this Letter, an alternative plasma- based ALE process for isotropic etching of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  is introduced involving  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma and trimethylaluminium [TMA,  $\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3$ ] pulses, providing higher etch rates and lower processing temperatures than conventional thermal ALE. This process illustrates that a fluorine- containing plasma can serve as a viable reactant for ALE and that plasmas—besides their conventional use in anisotropic ALE—can be employed for isotropic ALE. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements confirmed saturation of both  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma and TMA half- cycles, which results in an etch per cycle (EPC) of  $3.1\\pm 0.1\\mathrm{A}$  at  $260^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The isotropic nature of the plasma ALE process was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy analysis of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ - coated 3D trench structures after performing ALE cycles. A mechanism of fluorination by F radicals and ligand exchange reactions involving TMA is proposed for this plasma ALE process based on observations from infrared spectroscopy, which are supported by reactant synergy analysis. This work establishes the benefits that a plasma can deliver for isotropic ALE.",

By ensuring that each half- cycle is self- limiting, a high level of etch control can be achieved. Compared to currently available etch technologies, ALE typically offers accurate control of etch depth, minimal substrate damage, and a smooth surface after etching. $^{1,3,6}$  These properties are vital for fabrication of next generation devices such as gate- all- around transistors, $^{2,7}$  3D flash memory (3D NAND), $^{8}$  and high- electron- mobility- transistors. $^{9}$  Furthermore, ALE processes are also considered for other processing steps, such as surface preparation or cleaning to remove thin native oxides or contamination, $^{10}$  and as correction steps to improve the selectivity of area- selective deposition processes. $^{11 - 13}$",

Plasma ALE has so far predominantly been employed for anisotropic etching in which directional ions from the plasma play a role. In contrast, isotropic ALE typically involves thermal chemistries, where the activation energy of the reaction is overcome by employing an elevated substrate temperature. Thermal ALE processes often include fluorination, chlorination, or oxidation reactions, which readily proceed at elevated substrate temperatures without the need for a plasma. $^{10,11,14 - 21}$  As an emerging technique, the research on isotropic thermal ALE has focused on finding viable precursors and co- reactants to achieve etching of a variety of materials. A selection of these isotropic ALE processes can be seen in Table I. From the table, we can see that dielectrics are commonly etched using fluorination chemistries, whereas isotropic ALE of metals is often achieved using chlorination or oxidation reactions to generate a modified surface. $^{22,23}$  Recently, it has been shown that isotropic ALE can also be achieved in an alternative manner by employing radical- driven plasmas with a minimal ion contribution. $^{21,24 - 26}$  Radicals are",

        "text": "ALE of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  has previously been achieved by using fluorinating reactants, such as hydrogen fluoride (HF) derived from HF pyridine or sulphur tetrafluoride  $(\\mathrm{SF}_4)$ , combined with tri- methyl aluminium  $[\\mathrm{TMA}, \\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3]$ , dimethyl aluminium chloride  $[\\mathrm{DMAC}, \\mathrm{AlCl}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2]$ , or tin acetylacetone  $[\\mathrm{Sn}(\\mathrm{acac})_2]$  as an etchant.14- 20 One of the most documented approaches for ALE of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  is the use of HF and TMA.10,14- 19 Half- cycle A of this thermal ALE process consists of the formation of an  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3 / \\mathrm{AlO}_x\\mathrm{F}_y$  surface layer by exposure to HF gas. This modified layer can then be removed by dosing TMA in half- cycle B, which produces volatile Al- containing species [namely  $\\mathrm{AlF}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2]$  via a transmetalation ligand exchange reaction.14,16- 19 However, HF pyridine can be a difficult reactant to work with and, therefore, alternative co- reactants are desired. For example, in recent work,  $\\mathrm{SF}_4$  was explored as a replacement thermal reactant for the fluorination step.20 Another possible substitute for HF is a fluorine- containing plasma, such as sulfur hexafluoride  $(\\mathrm{SF}_6)$ , which is an inert non- toxic gas. When ignited as a plasma,  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  produces highly reactive fluorine radicals, which provide the aforementioned benefits of a plasma process.  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma is a promising alternative due to its widespread availability, ease of use, and safety benefits.27- 29 Since it is a commonly used etchant,  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasmas have been extensively studied and this knowledge can be leveraged to aid the development of atomic- scale processes.28,29  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasmas are known for having high concentrations of F radicals, which can be  $\\sim 10^3$  times higher in concentration than S radicals. Other neutral species such as  $\\mathrm{F}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{SF}_4$  can also be formed in an  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma, while the most prominent charged species are  $\\mathrm{SF}_6^+$  and  $\\mathrm{F}^-$  ions.30 In our previous work,  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma and TMA were employed at low temperatures to deposit  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  by plasma ALD.30 In that work, the growth per cycle (GPC) was seen to be strongly correlated with the substrate temperature, with higher temperatures giving a reduced GPC.30",

Since the  $\\mathrm{SF}_6 / \\mathrm{TMA}$  is inspired on an existing thermal ALE chemistry, the reaction mechanism as studied using infrared (IR) spectroscopy is discussed first. The observations from the IR experiments support a mechanism involving fluorination and ligand exchange reactions. Subsequently, it is confirmed that  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma and TMA satisfy the main requirements of ALE reaction in terms of saturation of the two half- cycles and synergy of the reactants. The merits of this process as compared to the thermal ALE process were assessed by measuring the etch rate as a function of temperature.

By monitoring the optical constants of the Si substrate using in situ SE,<sup>31,32</sup> this table temperature range was found to correspond to actual substrate temperatures between 140 and  $285^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The standard ALE cycle (with saturating doses of  $\\mathrm{SF_6}$  plasma and TMA determined at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ) was used for all temperatures.

At low temperatures, a transition from ALE to ALD is observed, indicated by a negative EPC value at  $140^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The transition temperature found in this study is lower than for thermal ALE processes using HF/TMA reported in the literature ( $170 - 250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ )<sup>14,17</sup> and is comparable to transition temperatures observed for HF/DMAC and  $\\mathrm{HF / Sn(acac)_2}$  (as shown in Fig. S3 of the supplementary material).

Using a large TMA dose will likely result in etching if the temperature is above the ALD/ALE transition temperature, while using a small TMA dose is more likely to lead to deposition. In comparison to thermal ALE, the plasma ALE process exhibits a higher EPC over the entire temperature range investigated here. A significant etch rate of  $0.8\\mathrm{\\AA} / \\mathrm{cycle}$  was already observed at a relatively low temperature of  $185^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , highlighting one of the benefits of using a plasma process.

        "text": "In summary, this work demonstrates that the isotropic plasma ALE of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  can be achieved using alternating pulses of  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma and TMA. A reaction mechanism for  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE was proposed where  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma fluorinates the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface and TMA etches the fluorinated surface region by producing volatile  $\\mathrm{AlF(CH_3)_2}$ . The etch rate was found to be strongly dependent on the substrate temperature, with higher temperatures yielding an increased EPC. When compared to thermal  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE processes, this plasma ALE process exhibits higher etch rates, as well as etching at low temperatures. The use of a plasma thereby extends the parameter space for isotropic ALE of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ , for example, by allowing for processing of substrates sensitive to high temperatures. TEM analysis revealed an isotropic etch profile on 3D trench structures, demonstrating that plasmas can be employed as reactants for isotropic ALE.  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma has been introduced as a viable co- reactant for isotropic ALE, highlighting that fluorine- containing plasmas are suitable for isotropic processing; however, care must be taken to avoid spontaneous etching of certain substrates. Future investigations will look to expand the  $\\mathrm{SF}_6$  plasma/TMA process to a wider range of materials, as well as identifying plasma chemistries beyond fluorination that can be employed for isotropic ALE. Overall, this work contributes to expanding the toolbox of isotropic plasma ALE, a technique that will aid in the fabrication of 3D structures for next generation semiconductor devices.",
