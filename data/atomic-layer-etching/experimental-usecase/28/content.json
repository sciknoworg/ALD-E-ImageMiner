        "text": "In this study, a cyclic isotropic plasma atomic layer etching (ALE) process was developed for aluminum oxide that involves fluorination with  $\\mathrm{NF}_3$  plasma and ligand exchange with trimethylaluminum (TMA). The isotropic plasma ALE consists of two steps: fluorination and removal. During the fluorination step, the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface was fluorinated to  $\\mathrm{AlOF}_x$  with  $\\mathrm{NF}_3$  plasma at  $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The formation of the  $\\mathrm{AlOF}_x$  layer was confirmed by x- ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and the atomic fraction of fluorine on the surface was saturated at  $25\\%$  after  $50~\\mathrm{s}$  of plasma fluorination. The depths of the fluorinated layers were in the range of  $0.79 - 1.14\\mathrm{nm}$  at different plasma powers. In the removal step, the fluorinated layer was removed by a ligand exchange reaction with TMA at an elevated temperature range of  $250 - 480^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The etch per cycle (EPC) was  $0.20 - 0.30\\mathrm{nm}$  cycle and saturated after  $30~\\mathrm{s}$  in the temperature range of  $290 - 330^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . No etching was observed below  $250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , and the EPC increased in the temperature range of  $250 - 300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  during the removal step with the ligand exchange reaction and reached the maximum at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Then, the EPC was significantly reduced at high temperatures, possibly due to TMA decomposition. The fluorine atomic fraction on the surface was reduced to  $14\\%$  after the removal. In conclusion,  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  was successfully etched at the atomic scale by the cyclic plasma ALE process. The average surface roughness of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  was reduced from  $8.6$  to  $5.3\\mathrm{\\AA}$  after 20 cycles of etching.",
