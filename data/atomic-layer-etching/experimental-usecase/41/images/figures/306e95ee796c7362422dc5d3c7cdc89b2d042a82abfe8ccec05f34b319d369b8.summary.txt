The bar chart illustrates the atomic fraction percentages of different elements (Ti2p, N1s, O1s, F1s, C1s) across three conditions: Ref., Oxidation, Fluorination, and Removal. The highest atomic fraction percentage is observed for O1s under the Oxidation condition at 40%, while the lowest is for F1s under the Removal condition at 2%.
