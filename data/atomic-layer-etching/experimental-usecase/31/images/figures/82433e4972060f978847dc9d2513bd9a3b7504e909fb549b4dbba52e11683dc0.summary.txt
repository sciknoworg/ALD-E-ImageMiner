The chart illustrates the etch rate of HfO₂ thickness at 100°C over different process cycles using two methods: Hhfac gas + O₂ plasma and Hhfac plasma + O₂ plasma. The etch rate for both methods decreases as the number of cycles increases, with the Hhfac plasma method showing a slightly higher initial thickness compared to the Hhfac gas method.
