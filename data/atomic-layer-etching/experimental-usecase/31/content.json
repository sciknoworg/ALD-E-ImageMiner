        "text": "As integrated circuit devices continue to shrink, achieving sub- 3 nm technology nodes requires innovative 3D architectures along with the advent of advanced materials and processes. From an etching perspective, traditional reactive ion etching (RIE), which uses reactive ions and neutral species, becomes increasingly inadequate for atomic- scale dimensions due to surface damage from ion bombardment and the high surface- to- volume ratio. Atomic layer etching (ALE) presents a superior alternative, utilizing two complementary self- limiting steps. By alternating between surface modification and removal phases, ALE enables atomic- level control over etching, surpassing the limitations of traditional RIE methods. In this study, we utilized hexafluoroacetylacetone (Hhfac) and O radicals, generated by a hollow cathode plasma source, as the primary etching agents for various high- k including  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ ,  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ ,  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ , and  $\\mathrm{Y}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  thin films. Our research focused on elucidating the adsorption dynamics of Hhfac, which contribute to significant volatilization upon interaction with O radicals, leading to self- limiting etching with atomic- scale precision. Detailed surface reactions, mass variations, and volatile etch byproducts were systematically analyzed using X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in- situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and in- situ residual gas analyzer (RGA). These analyses provided both theoretical and experimental insights into the etching mechanisms. This work presents a layer- by- layer removal method for various high- k materials, enabling the creation of sharp interfaces and high aspect ratio patterns and contributes to a deeper understanding of etching pathways, particularly in the Ångström era of device scaling.",

This ongoing reduction in device dimensions has necessitated the adoption of new materials and processes compatible with advanced 3D nanodevice integration, such as gate- allaround (GAA) transistors, which feature high surface- to- volume ratios [2- 4]. Particularly, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of high- k oxides such as  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$  with their high dielectric constants (k), low electrical leakage, and excellent thermal stability, has been widely utilized as replacements for  $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$  in modern semiconductor devices for over 10 years [5]. More recently, there has been a need to precisely reduce the thickness of high- k oxides while preserving the crystallinity that emerges beyond a certain thickness, driven by performance and geometric limitations. Additionally, achieving precise etching profiles of high- k oxides without footing issues has led to their consideration as potential hard mask materials in next- generation EUV lithography, enabling accurate pattern transfer with vertical sidewalls [6].",

Each ALE cycle consists of two distinct reactions. The first reaction, known as the surface modification step, involves the interaction of incoming chemical species, such as precursors or activated radicals, with the underlying substrate, resulting in the formation of a chemically modified layer [10]. This modified layer reduces the threshold energy required for its removal and prevents unintended etching of the underlying material. The second reaction involves ion bombardment, where moderate- energy ions provide sufficient kinetic energy to selectively remove the chemically modified layer [10,13]. This removal step ensures precise elimination of the modified layer while protecting non- targeted areas, enabling outstanding etch selectivity, layer- by- layer etching, and minimal damage to the material beneath.",

        "text": "In the first step of chemical modification, thermal adsorption can be utilized in lieu of plasma modification, enabling the formation of a modified layer with greater atomic- scale fidelity. This method offers a more precise and controlled modification compared to plasma- based techniques, ensuring better consistency and minimizing damage to the underlying material. This thermal adsorption method is particularly advantageous when combined with diketones, which have been studied as one of effective precursors for ALE of metal or metal oxide films due to their exceptional reactivity and strong affinity for metals [14- 17]. These diketones feature two oxygen atoms capable of simultaneously binding to a single metal center, forming stable chelate complexes. The tunable nature of diketones allows for modifications to the ligand groups, impacting steric effects, acidity, and volatility, thereby enabling tailored etch rates and selectivity [17]. When used in ALE of metal or metal oxides with diketonates, the ALE process typically begins with an oxidation or chlorination step to elevate the metal to a higher oxidation state. This is followed by the chelation step, where diketones, such as hexafluoroacetylacetone (Hhfac) and acetylacetone (Hacac), form volatile metal- ligand complexes [15- 19]. However, while diketones are well- known for their remarkable coordination capabilities, their use in ALE for metal oxides has been primarily limited to those with  $+2$  oxidation states, such as  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  and CoO. This limitation arises from the steric hindrance associated with higher oxidation states, which complicates the formation of stable, volatile chelate complexes. Specifically, the requirement for three or four acac or hfac ligands to induce volatility is hindered by spatial constraints, making it difficult to form stable complexes with high- valency metals. As a result, no prior studies have specifically explored ALE for high- k thin films such as  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  which exhibit  $^{4 + }$  oxidation states (i.e.,  $\\mathrm{Hf^{4 + }}$ $\\mathrm{Zr^{4 + }}$  and present additional challenges in forming volatile complexes. Indeed, previous ALE studies on  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  films using Haec and  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma demonstrated exceptional selectivity against  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ $(- 8:1)$  and  $\\mathrm{SiO_2 / HfO_2}$ $(- 80:1)$  , highlighting the inefficiency of diketone- based volatilization for these oxides [17]. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the exact etch byproducts and underlying etching mechanisms remains yet to be explored. Furthermore, although several attempts have been made to utilize theoretical calculations and modeling to elucidate reaction mechanisms at the atomic- scale processing, [20- 22] a comprehensive understanding of the exact etch by- products and underlying etching mechanisms remains yet to be explored.",

To optimize the volatilization of the modified layer in the subsequent step of the ALE process, we employed a remote hollow cathode plasma (HCP) source, which generates neutral oxygen radicals. Compared to direct capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) sources, this remote plasma configuration provides higher radical densities while minimizing plasma- induced damage to the substrate. This study systematically investigates the ALE characteristics and fundamental aspects of the proposed ALE chemistry, primarily focusing on the temperature- dependent adsorption dynamics of Hhfac molecules, which pertain to their crucial role in volatilization upon exposure to subsequent O radicals, especially for high- k oxides with  $^{4 + }$  oxidation states. To uncover the detailed molecular interactions and mechanistic pathways, a combination of techniques was employed, including X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface composition analysis, in- situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for real- time mass variation monitoring, and residual gas analysis (RGA) for identifying volatile etch byproducts.

Fig. 1b schematically illustrates the overall etching mechanism. Initially, Hhfac molecules adsorb onto the high- k oxide surface, where dissociative chemisorption results in the formation of fluorinated surface species such as  $\\mathrm{CF_x}$  and  $\\mathrm{OCF_x}$ . These species chemically passivate and modify the topmost layer, thereby lowering its binding energy. In the subsequent step, oxygen radicals generated from the HCP source react with the modified surface. These radicals induce a series of oxidation reactions that cleave molecular bonds, forming volatile compounds such as  $\\mathrm{Hf - CF_x}$  and  $\\mathrm{Hf - OCF_x}$ . This process enables chemical fragmentation and volatilization of surface species, rather than physical desorption of intact layers.

The first 12 cycles using  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  gas showed no significant mass loss, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3a. For the following 40 cycles of Hhfac and O radical dosing, a mass gain of approximately  $10\\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$  per cycle was observed after Hhfac dosing, attributed to the passivation effect from the adsorption of Hhfac molecules onto the surface. Following the O radical pulse, a cumulative mass loss of about  $60~\\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$  per cycle was observed, corresponding to the radical- driven removal of the modified  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  layer. The QCM measurements revealed a mass gain of only  $\\sim 10\\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$  per Hhfac pulse, quantitatively confirming the steric hindrance phenomenon hypothesized in our etching mechanism and demonstrating restricted surface coverage of Hhfac ligands. Based on its molecular weight  $(\\sim 616\\mathrm{g / mol})$  and crystallographic footprint  $(100 - 130\\mathrm{\\AA}^2$  per molecule) [23], a densely packed monolayer would correspond to approximately  $80\\mathrm{- }100\\mathrm{ng / cm^2}$ . This notable discrepancy is primarily attributed to dissociative adsorption at  $300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , where Hhfac molecules decompose upon surface contact rather than adsorbing intact.
