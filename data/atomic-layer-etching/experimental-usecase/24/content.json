        "text": "ABSTRACT: Trimethylaluminum (TMA,  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}$ ) was used as the metal precursor, together with HF, for the atomic layer etching (ALE) of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  using sequential, self- limiting thermal reactions.  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE using TMA demonstrates that other metal precursors, in addition to  $\\mathrm{Sn(acac)}_2,$  can be employed for  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE. The use of TMA for  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE is especially interesting because TMA can also be used for  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  atomic layer deposition (ALD). Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) experiments monitored  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE at temperatures from 250 to  $325^{\\circ}C$  The  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE was linear versus the number of HF and TMA reaction cycles. The QCM studies showed that the sequential HF and TMA reactions were self limiting versus reactant exposure. The  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  etching rates increased at higher temperatures. The QCM analysis measured mass change per cycle (MCPC) values that varied from  $- 4.2\\mathrm{ng / (cm^2}$  cycle) at  $250^{\\circ}C$  to  $- 23.3\\mathrm{ng / (cm^2}$  cycle) at  $325^{\\circ}C$  These MCPCs correspond to  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  etch rates from  $0.14\\mathrm{\\AA / }$  cycle at  $250^{\\circ}C$  to  $0.75\\mathrm{\\AA / }$  cycle at  $325^{\\circ}C$  X- ray reflectivity and spectroscopic elipsometry analyses confirmed the linear removal of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and etching rates. Further transform infrared spectroscopy measurements monitored  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE by observing the loss of infrared absorbance from Al- O stretching vibrations. Surface intermediates were also identified after the HF and TMA exposures.  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  ALE with TMA is believed to occur by the reaction  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3 + 4\\mathrm{Al}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_3 + 6\\mathrm{HF}\\rightarrow 6\\mathrm{AlF}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2 + 3\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  The proposed mechanism involves fluorination and ligand- exchange reactions. The HF exposure fluorinates the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and forms an  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  surface layer and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as a volatile reaction product. During the ligand- exchange transmetalation reaction, TMA accepts F from the  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  surface layer and donates  $\\mathrm{CH}_3$  to produce volatile  $\\mathrm{AlF}(\\mathrm{CH}_3)_2$  reaction products. The QCM measurements were consistent with an  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  surface layer thickness of  $3.0\\mathrm{\\AA}$  on  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  after the HF exposures. The larger etch rates at higher temperatures were attributed to the removal of a larger fraction of the  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  surface layer by TMA exposures at higher temperatures.",

This behavior results from the increase in MCPC and the decrease in  $\\mathcal{X}$  at higher temperatures. These temperature dependences yield a nearly constant xMCPC product versus temperature. Because  $\\mathcal{X}$  is defined relative to the amount of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  that is etched during the ALE reaction, the absolute  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}^*$  coverages are proportional to xMCPC. The nearly constant xMCPC values in Table 1 indicate that the absolute  $\\mathrm{Al(CH_3)_3}^*$  coverages are similar at all the etching temperatures. The larger etch rates at higher temperatures are attributed to the higher percentage of the  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  surface layer removed by ligand- exchange reactions during TMA exposures at higher temperatures.",
