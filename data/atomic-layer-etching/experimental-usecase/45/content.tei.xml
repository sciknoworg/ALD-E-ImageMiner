<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of TiN was demonstrated using a new etching mechanism based on sequential, selflimiting oxidation and fluorination reactions. The oxidation reactant was either O 3 or H 2 O 2 , and the fluorination reactant was hydrogen fluoride (HF) derived from HF-pyridine. In the proposed reaction mechanism, the O 3 reaction oxidizes the surface of the TiN substrate to a TiO 2 layer and gaseous NO. HF exposure to the TiO 2 layer then produces TiF 4 and H 2 O as volatile reaction products. The overall reaction can be written as TiN + 3O 3 + 4HF → TiF 4 + 3O 2 + NO + 2H 2 O. Quartz crystal microbalance studies showed that HF can spontaneously etch TiO 2 films. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray reflectivity analysis showed that TiN films were etched linearly versus the number of ALE cycles using O 3 and HF as the reactants. The TiN etching also occurred selectively in the presence of Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , SiO 2 , and Si 3 N 4 . The etch rate for TiN ALE was determined at temperatures from 150 to 350 °C. The etch rates increased with temperature from 0.06 Å/cycle at 150 °C to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 °C and stayed nearly constant for temperatures ≥250 °C. TiN ALE was also accomplished using H 2 O 2 and HF as the reactants. The etch rate was 0.15 Å/cycle at 250 °C. The TiN films were smoothed by TiN ALE using either the O 3 or H 2 O 2 oxidation reactants. The thermal ALE of many other metal nitrides should be possible using this new etching mechanism based on oxidation and fluorination reactions. This thermal ALE mechanism should also be applicable to metal carbides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, and elemental metals that have volatile metal fluorides.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Atomic layer etching (ALE) is a thin-film removal method based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> ALE is usually defined by two separate reactions that enable atomiclevel removal of thin films. The ALE process is the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> The first reaction during ALE is often an activation step where the surface of the film is modified by adsorption of a reactive species. The second reaction is then the removal of this activated layer using highenergy collisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Energetic ions or noble gas atoms have been used to remove the activated material in many previously reported ALE processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Thermal ALE processes have also been developed recently using sequential, self-limiting fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> For metal oxide ALE, a gas-phase fluorination reagent, such as HF, forms a stable and nonvolatile fluoride layer on the metal oxide film. Metal reagents then can remove the fluoride layer through ligand-exchange transmetalation reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Thermal ALE processes for Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , ZnO, SiO 2 , AlN, and AlF 3 have been demonstrated using HF and various metal precursors such as Sn(acac) 2 , trimethylaluminum, dimethylaluminum chloride, and silicon tetrachloride. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> The thermal ALE process using fluorination and ligandexchange reactions has not been able to etch some metal nitrides, such as titanium nitride (TiN). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> TiN is an important material as a copper diffusion barrier and a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) gate electrode material in semiconductor devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Previous thermal ALE studies have observed that TiN was not etched using HF together with a variety of metal precursors for ligand-exchange. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> One reason for observing no etching is that the oxidation state of Ti in TiN is 3+. Fluorination would retain the oxidation state by fluorinating TiN to TiF 3 . However, the oxidation state of Ti is 4+ for most stable and volatile Ti compounds. The ligandexchange process for TiF 3 does not produce a stable and volatile reaction product. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Different approaches are needed for thermal TiN ALE. A new thermal ALE process can be defined by sequential, selflimiting oxidation and fluorination reactions as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The first step is the oxidation reaction where an ozone (O 3 ) exposure produces a titanium oxide (TiO 2 ) surface layer on the TiN substrate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">+ → + + TiN 3O TiO NO 3O 3 2 2 (1)</formula><p>O 3 is a strong oxidant that is able to convert the oxidation state of Ti from 3+ to 4+. This oxidation reaction is thermochemically favorable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> O 3 can also form a stable, self-passivating TiO 2 layer. The TiO 2 layer forms a diffusion barrier that impedes further oxidation and leads to a self-limiting oxidation reaction.</p><p>A fluorinating reagent, such as HF, can then react with TiO 2 and form a volatile titanium tetrafluoride (TiF 4 ) reaction product:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">+ → + TiO 4HF TiF 2H O 2 4 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This fluorination reaction is thermochemically favorable at room temperature and becomes less favorable at higher temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The TiF 4 reaction product will be removed from the surface because of its high volatility. H 2 O is also produced as a volatile reaction product. The O 3 and HF reactions can then be repeated to etch the TiN substrate with atomic layer control. The thermal ALE process shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> using oxidation and fluorination reactions is very different from the previous thermal ALE approach using fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions. In the new process illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, HF etches the TiO 2 layer by producing volatile TiF 4 . In contrast, the fluorination step in the previous thermal ALE approach has been used to form stable and nonvolatile metal fluorides such as AlF 3 , ZrF 4 , and HfF 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> These stable metal fluorides were then removed by a ligand-exchange reaction.</p><p>This new thermal ALE process should be valuable for a number of conducting transition metal nitrides such as TiN, VN, TaN, and WN. These metal nitrides have an oxidation state of 3+ that is lower than the oxidation state in their fully oxidized forms. The fluorides of these metal nitrides may have difficulty undergoing ligand-exchange reactions. However, oxidation can convert these metal nitrides to metal oxides with higher oxidation states. For example, the TiO 2 , V 2 O 5 , Ta 2 O 5 , and WO 3 metal oxides have oxidation states of 4+, 5+, 5+, and 6+, respectively. The TiF 4 , VF 5 , TaF 5 , and WF 6 metal fluorides that may form during the fluorination of these metal oxides have high volatility and share the same high oxidation states as their respective metal oxides.</p><p>In this work, thermal TiN ALE was demonstrated using oxidation and fluorination reactions. O 3 or H 2 O 2 vapor was employed as the oxidation reactant. HF vapor derived from HF-pyridine solution was used as the fluorination reactant. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure the thicknesses of TiN thin films on silicon wafers versus the number of ALE cycles. X-ray reflectivity measurement was also employed to confirm the thickness changes as well as to determine the roughness of the TiN film after ALE reactions.</p><p>The oxidation and fluorination reactions were also used to demonstrate the selective etching of TiN in the presence of other materials such as Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , SiO 2 , and Si 3 N 4 . These materials are all important materials in semiconductor fabrication processes. This thermal ALE strategy using oxidation and fluorination reactions that yield a volatile metal fluoride is general and should provide a pathway for the thermal ALE of a number of new materials. In addition to other metal nitrides, possible new materials include metal carbides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, and elemental metals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION</head><p>All the reactions were conducted in a viscous-flow, hot-wall reactor defined by a stainless steel tube with the length of ∼60 cm and inside diameter of 3.8 cm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> The reactor was isothermally heated by heating elements attached to the outside of the stainless steel tube. The reaction temperatures from 150 to 350 °C were stabilized within ±0.04 °C of the set point by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) temperature controller (2604, Eurotherm). A constant flow of 150 sccm UHP nitrogen gas (N 2 , 99.999%, Airgas) was regulated by mass flow controllers (Type 1179A, MKS). This N 2 gas flow established a base pressure of ∼1 Torr in the reactor when pumped by a mechanical pump (Pascal 2015SD, Alcatel). The pressure was recorded by a capacitance manometer (Baratron 121A, MKS).</p><p>The demonstration of spontaneous etching of TiO 2 was performed using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) located at the center of the hot-wall reactor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> The gold-coated quartz crystal (polished, RC crystal, 6 MHz, Phillip Technologies) was placed in a sensor head (BSH-150, Inficon) and sealed with high-temperature epoxy (Epo-Tek H21D, Epoxy Technology). The mass changes during the reactions were measured by a thin-film deposition monitor (Maxtek TM-400, Inficon). The TiO 2 films were deposited on the QCM crystal using TiO 2 ALD with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4 , 99%, Strem) and deionized H 2 O (Chromasolv for HPLC, Sigma-Aldrich) as the reactants at 200, 250, and 300 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> HF exposures on these TiO 2 ALD films were performed at the same temperature as the TiO 2 ALD reactions.</p><p>The HF source was a HF-pyridine solution (70 wt % HF, Sigma-Aldrich). A gold-plated stainless steel bubbler was filled with the HFpyridine solution in a dry N 2 -filled glovebag and held at room temperature. A HF vapor pressure of 90-100 Torr was in equilibrium with the HF-pyridine solution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Only HF vapor was delivered in the gas phase as confirmed by mass spectrometry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The pressure transients of HF were adjusted to ∼80 mTorr using a metering bellows-sealed valve (SS-4BMG, Swagelok).</p><p>The O 3 was produced in a corona discharge ozone generator (LG-14, Del Ozone). A flow of 480 sccm of UHP oxygen gas (O 2 , 99.994%, Airgas) was supplied to produce a maximum ∼5 wt % of O 3 in O 2 . When the O 3 was not delivered to the reactor, the O 3 was passed through an ozone destruct unit (ODS-1, Ozone Solutions) connected to the exhaust line. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) vapor was evaporated with H 2 O from a H 2 O 2 solution (50 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) contained in a glass bubbler. The H 2 O 2 solution was held at room temperature.</p><p>The TiN films were prepared by SEMATECH. The TiN film was deposited on a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer by semiconductor ALD processes in commercially available tools. The initial thickness of TiN was measured as ∼70 Å by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements. The TiN film on the silicon wafers was cleaved to produce samples that were  were prepared by SEMATECH and deposited by ALD processes. The SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 films were prepared by SEMATECH and deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes.</p><p>Al 2 O 3 ALD films were coated inside the reactor before TiN ALE to minimize O 3 decomposition on the walls of the hot-wall reactor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> The ALE reactions were conducted using a reaction sequence represented as x-30-y-30. This reaction sequence consists of an exposure of the oxidation reagent for x s, 30 s of N 2 purge, y s of HF exposure, and 30 s of N 2 purge. The ALE reactions using O 3 as an oxidation reagent were performed using an optimized reaction sequence of 3-30-1-30. The ALE reactions using H 2 O 2 as an oxidation source were performed using an optimized reaction sequence of 2.5-30-1-30.</p><p>Ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements determined the thicknesses of the various films. Ψ and Δ at 240-900 nm were measured by a spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000, J. A. Woollam) and fitted by the analysis software (CompleteEASE, J. A. Woollam). These measurements employed an incidence angle of 75°near the Brewster angle of the silicon wafer. A Lorentz model was used for fitting the thickness of the TiN film. A Sellmeier model was used for fitting of the Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , SiO 2 , and Si 3 N 4 films.</p><p>The thicknesses, roughness, and film density were obtained by ex situ XRR analysis. The X-ray reflectivity (XRR) scans at 300-9000 arcsec were measured by a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (Bede D1, Jordan Valley Semiconductors) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 Å). The filament voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 35 mA in the X-ray tube. All XRR scans were recorded with a 10 arcsec step size and a 5 s acquisition time and fitted using the analysis software (Bede REFS, Jordan Valley Semiconductors) to determine film thickness, film density, and surface roughness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>A. Spontaneous Etching of TiO 2 by HF. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the mass changes during 10 consecutive HF exposures on TiO 2 films grown on the quartz crystal microbalance. The TiO 2 ALD films were deposited using TiCl 4 and H 2 O as the reactants at 200, 250, and 300 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Each HF exposure for 1 s leads to a mass loss consistent with spontaneous etching of the TiO 2 film. The average mass change during the HF exposure is -17 ng/ cm 2 at 200 °C. There are slightly higher mass changes at higher temperatures. Mass changes of -25 and -32 ng/cm 2 were obtained with the same HF exposure time of 1 s at 250 and 300 °C, respectively. These results suggest that an HF exposure of 1 s is able to etch a TiO 2 thickness of 0.66-0.85 Å at 250-300 °C based on the density of 3.76 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> for TiO 2 ALD films. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> The fluorination reaction given by eq 2 has a standard reaction enthalpy ΔH°= -22.7 kcal/mol at 25 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> This negative enthalpy value is maintained at high temperatures with ΔH°= -21.9 kcal/mol at 250 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The standard free energy of this reaction is favorable at room temperature with ΔG°= -6.1 kcal/mol at 25 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The standard free energy change becomes unfavorable at temperatures &gt;150 °C for entropic reasons. The ΔG°value at 250 °C is +6.3 kcal/mol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> However, the ΔG values for the HF reaction with TiO 2 may be negative and may predict a spontaneous reaction under nonstandard conditions. The etching could be favorable in the presence of excess of HF vapor when the TiF 4 and H 2 O reaction products are quickly removed by the N 2 purge gas.</p><p>B. Thermal TiN ALE Using O 3 and HF. Previous studies have shown that HF by itself or in conjunction with other metal precursors cannot etch TiN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> However, HF is able to etch TiO 2 spontaneously as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. These results suggest that if a TiO 2 layer can be formed on a TiN substrate using an oxidizing reagent, then a fluorination reagent, such as HF, should be able to etch the TiO 2 layer on the TiN substrate. These oxidation and fluorination reactions define the thermal TiN ALE process illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Ozone (O 3 ) is a gas-phase reagent with strong oxidation power. O 3 has often been preferred to O 2 as an oxygen source for metal oxide ALD when its stronger oxidizing ability is needed, or the H 2 O purge is difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> In addition, O 3 is also known to form an excellent passivation oxide layer on polycrystalline aluminum metal or crystalline silicon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> O 3 also can be employed as an oxidation reagent for the formation of a TiO 2 layer on the TiN substrate.</p><p>The proposed oxidation reaction of TiN using O 3 is given by eq 1. This oxidation reaction is thermochemically favorable. The standard free energy of this reaction is ΔG°= -242.1 kcal/ mol at 250 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Other nitrogen-containing reaction products in addition to NO, such as N 2 and NO 2 , may be possible. The ΔG°values with N 2 or NO 2 as the reaction product yield favorable standard free energy values of ΔG°= -219 or -288 kcal/mol at 250 °C, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The fluorination reaction of HF with TiO 2 is given by eq 2. This reaction has ΔG°values of -6.1 kcal/mol at 25 °C and +6.3 kcal/mol at 250 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> As discussed above in Section A, the positive ΔG°value at 250 °C does not preclude the reaction because the reactions are not performed under standard conditions. The production of TiF 4 can lead to etching because TiF 4 is a volatile solid that sublimes at 284 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> After HF removes the TiO 2 layer on the TiN substrate, HF could also form TiF 3 by fluorination of TiN. The reaction between TiN and HF is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">+ → + TiN(s) 3HF(g) TiF (s) NH (g)<label>3 3</label></formula><p>(3</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>This reaction is favorable with a ΔG°value of -37.0 kcal/mol at 250 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> TiF 3 is a nonvolatile solid with a melting point of 1200 °C and boiling point of 1400 °C. 29 TiF 3 may act as an etch stop. However, the HF reaction with TiN may not occur if HF does not remove the entire TiO 2 film or does not remove the TiO x N y layer at the interface between TiO 2 and TiN.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and Xray reflectivity (XRR) measurements of the initial TiN film thickness and the TiN film thickness after 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 ALE cycles using O 3 and HF as the reactants at 250 °C. The film thickness versus the number of ALE cycles is linear. An etch rate of 0.19 Å/cycle was obtained from the SE measurements using a least-squares fitting. The XRR measure- ments on the same samples yielded an etch rate of 0.20 Å/ cycle. These XRR results are consistent with the SE results.</p><p>No TiN etch was observed when using O 2 by itself as the oxidation reactant together with HF. The oxidation reaction TiN(s) + 3 / 2 O 2 (g) → TiO 2 (s) + NO(g) is thermochemically favorable having a standard free energy change of ΔG°= -113.7 kcal at 250 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> However, the oxidation of TiN by O 2 at &lt;350 °C is known to slowly form a thin TiO 2 layer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> The surface of TiN also reacts with O 2 and creates an intermediate titanium oxynitride (TiO x N y ) phase, in addition to a thin TiO 2 layer. The oxidation state of Ti in this intermediate phase is 3+ and 4+ by XPS analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> The strong oxidizing ability of O 3 may be necessary for the oxidation of TiN or TiO x N y to TiO 2 . The TiO 2 layer can then be etched by HF during TiN ALE at 250 °C.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the self-limiting behavior for the O 3 and HF exposures during TiN ALE at 250 °C. The etch rates were obtained versus reactant exposure time while holding the other reactant exposure time constant. The etch rate was determined using the average thickness change during 200 ALE cycles. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref> examines the self-limiting reaction using different O 3 exposure times with a HF exposure time of 1 s. A N 2 purge time of 30 s was used between reactant exposures. The etch rate increases and levels off at ∼0.2 Å/cycle versus the O 3 exposure time. The oxidation of the TiN substrate is believed to be self-limiting because of the formation of a TiO 2 passivation layer on the TiN substrate that acts as a diffusion barrier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref> examines the self-limiting reaction using different HF exposure times with an O 3 exposure time of 3 s. The etch rate versus the HF exposure time increases and levels off at ∼0.2 Å/cycle. The fluorination reaction is self-limiting because the etching reaction to produce volatile TiF 4 and H 2 O is limited by the thickness of the TiO 2 layer on the TiN substrate. HF does not etch the TiN film by itself. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows that an HF exposure of 1 s is able to remove 25 ng/cm 2 or 0.66 Å of a TiO 2 film at 250 °C. This thickness of TiO 2 film removed by the HF exposure is much greater than the etch rate of 0.2 Å/cycle for the TiO 2 layer on the TiN substrate.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows results for TiN ALE in the presence of various materials. These results demonstrate the selective etching of TiN using O 3 and HF as the reactants at 250 °C.    could also not etch silicon oxide and silicon nitride. In the absence of H 2 O, dry HF can not etch SiO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> Previous thermal ALE studies using fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions could also not etch SiO 2 or Si 3 N 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> New approaches are needed for SiO 2 ALE and Si 3 N 4 ALE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows XRR scans for the initial TiN film on the Si wafer and for TiN films after various numbers of ALE cycles with O 3 and HF as the reactants at 250 °C. The initial TiN film thickness is reduced linearly after various numbers of ALE cycles as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The XRR scans also reveal the roughness of the TiN films versus the ALE cycles. The roughness of initial TiN film was 9.3 Å. The roughness was then reduced as the TiN film was smoothed by the ALE process. The etched TiN films have roughness values of 8.5, 8.2, and 7.5 Å after 25, 50, and 100 ALE cycles, respectively. This decreased roughness versus number of TiN ALE cycles is consistent with the surface smoothing observed by previous studies of Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2 ALE using fluorination and ligandexchange reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> shows the TiN ALE etch rates obtained at different temperatures using O 3 and HF as the reactants. The etch rates were obtained by the average of the thickness change measured by SE after 200 ALE cycles. All ALE reactions used an optimized reaction sequence of 3-30-1-30. The etch rate is 0.060 Å/cycle at 150 °C and increases to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 °C. The etch rates are then constant with temperature between 250 and 350 °C. This result may indicate that a similar thickness for the TiO 2 layer is formed by O 3 and removed by HF at 250-350 °C. The HF can only remove the amount of TiO 2 that is formed during the O 3 exposure. This constant etch rate over a range of temperatures is similar to the "ALD window" often observed for many ALD processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> O 3 decomposition at high temperatures could affect the uniformity of the TiN film thicknesses in the reactor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> For exploration of this issue, studies were performed using 200 ALE cycles at 250, 300, and 350 °C where the etch rate was nearly constant according to the results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>. Five TiN film samples were placed within a length of 12.7 cm in the hot-wall reactor as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. The TiN thicknesses were measured before and after the 200 ALE cycles to determine the uniformity of the TiN film. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref> shows uniformity results obtained at a higher temperature of 350 °C. These film thicknesses after 200 ALE cycles indicate that a lower etch rate is observed at the downstream positions. These downstream positions are furthest from the reactant entry into the hot-wall reactor. The recombination between gaseous O 3 molecules is negligible at a reaction pressure of ∼1 Torr. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Consequently, this result   may indicate that O 3 is undergoing some decomposition on the surfaces of the hot-wall reactor.</p><p>The decomposition of O 3 may be accelerated at the high temperature of 350 °C. This decomposition may lead to lower O 3 concentrations downstream in the reactor. These lower O 3 concentrations then produce lower TiN etch rates and thicker TiN film thicknesses. Similar effects were observed for ZnO ALD as a function of position in the reactor using Zn(CH 2 CH 3 ) 2 and O 3 as the reactants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Thinner ZnO ALD films were observed downstream in the reactor at 200 °C because of the lower O 3 concentrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> C. Thermal TiN ALE Using H 2 O 2 and HF. Other oxidants, in addition to O 3 , may be able to oxidize the TiN substrate and form a TiO 2 layer. H 2 O 2 is a strong oxidizer that has been used as a reactant for metal oxide ALD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> H 2 O 2 /H 2 O vapor derived from 30 to 50 wt % H 2 O 2 solution has been used for ALD. H 2 O 2 is a stronger oxidizer than O 2 , but weaker than O 3 . The redox potential of oxidants measured in solution is consistent with this order of oxidant strength. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> The proposed oxidation reaction of TiN using H 2 O 2 can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">+ → + + TiN(s) 3H O (g) TiO (s) NO(g) 3H O(g) 2 2 2 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>This oxidation reaction is thermochemically favorable. The standard free energy is ΔG°= -211.6 kcal/mol at 250 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">10</ref> shows the SE and XRR measurements of the initial TiN film thickness and the TiN film thickness after 50, 100, 200, and 400 ALE cycles using H 2 O 2 and HF as the reactants at 250 °C. The film thickness versus the number of ALE cycles is linear. An etch rate of 0.15 Å/cycle was obtained by SE using a least-squares fitting. The XRR measurements on the same samples yielded an etch rate of 0.14 Å/cycle that is consistent with the SE results.</p><p>The ALE reactions using H 2 O 2 and HF were also selflimiting. However, achieving reproducible results was challenging because of changes in the H 2 O 2 concentration. Purging the excess H 2 O after the H 2 O 2 /H 2 O exposure was also difficult. There also may be a thermal decomposition of H 2 O 2 at high temperatures. These factors contributed to making H 2 O 2 more problematic than O 3 as an oxidant for TiN ALE. using H 2 O 2 and HF as the reactants at 250 °C. The initial TiN film thickness of 63 Å was reduced versus number of ALE cycles as shown in Figure 10. The initial TiN film roughness was 9.3 Å. This roughness was reduced to 8.1 Å after 50 cycles and 6.5 Å after 100 ALE cycles. These measurements indicate that the TiN films were smoothed by TiN ALE using H 2 O 2 and HF as the reactants. These results are consistent with the TiN film smoothing obtained from Figure 6 during TiN ALE using O 3 and HF as the reactants. D. Generality of Thermal ALE Using Oxidation and Fluorination Reactions. The ALE of other materials including metal nitrides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, and   elemental metals should be possible using sequential, selflimiting oxidation and fluorination reactions. This approach requires that oxidation by oxidants, such as O 3 and H 2 O 2 , is able to form a self-passivating metal oxide layer with a finite thickness that prevents further oxidation. The fluorination reactants, such as HF and SF 4 , then remove only the metal oxide layer formed during the oxidation step. The removal occurs because the fluorides produced by the fluorination reactions are volatile. The oxygen in the metal oxide is removed as H 2 O and SO 2 by HF and SF 4 , respectively.</p><p>ALE processes using oxidation and fluorination reactions for representative materials are given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The oxidation reactions for many transition metal nitrides that have volatile metal fluorides, such as TiN, to form their corresponding metal oxides are very favorable. The ΔG°values for the oxidation of TiN, TaN, NbN, VN, W 2 N, Mo 2 N, MoN, and CrN using O 3 to form TiO 2 , Ta 2 O 5 , Nb 2 O 5 , V 2 O 5 , WO 3 , MoO 3 , MoO 3 , and CrO 3 are -241, -296, -284, -246, -294, -280, and -238 kcal/mol at 250 °C, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The ΔG°values for oxidation using H 2 O 2 are somewhat lower, but still very favorable, with ΔG°values &lt;-200 kcal/mol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The fluorinations of these metal oxides should all yield volatile metal fluorides. The ΔG°values for the fluorination of TiO 2 , Ta 2 O 5 , Nb 2 O 5 , V 2 O 5 , WO 3 , MoO 3 , and CrO 3 using SF 4 to form TiF 4 , TaF 5 , NbF 5 , VF 5 , WF 6 , MoF 6 , and CrF 6 are -62, -79, -74, -45, -68, -53, and -40 kcal/mol at 250 °C, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> These metal fluorides are all volatile. For other metal nitrides that do not produce volatile fluorides after the fluorination of the metal oxide, a ligand-exchange reaction may be required to remove the metal fluoride. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Metal carbides are important materials that can be used as gate electrode materials with low work functions in semiconductor devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Metal carbides have many similar properties to metal nitrides such as structure, bonding characteristics, and electronic properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> The oxidation reactions for transition metal carbides to form their corresponding metal oxides are very favorable. The ΔG°values for the oxidation of TaC, VC, and W 2 C using O 3 to form Ta 2 O 5 , V 2 O 5 , and WO 3 are -369, -321, and -334 kcal/mol at 250 °C, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> These reactions assume CO as an etching product. The Ta 2 O 5 , V 2 O 5 , and WO 3 metal oxides then should produce volatile fluorides during the fluorination reaction using HF or SF 4 .</p><p>Transition metal sulfides and selenides are important 2D semiconductor materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> The oxidation of metal sulfides and selenides to form their corresponding metal oxides is also favorable. The ΔG°values for the oxidation of WS 2 , MoS 2 , WSe 2 , and MoSe 2 using O 3 to form WO 3 , MoO 3 , WO 3 , and MoO 3 are -553, -526, -531, and -515 kcal/mol at 250 °C, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The oxidation should also yield volatile SO 2 or SeO 3 reaction products. In addition to these thermochemical calculations, previous studies have recently reported the oxidation of WSe 2 to form a WO x layer on WSe 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> These metal oxides should then form volatile metal fluorides after fluorination with SF 4 .</p><p>Elemental metals with volatile metal fluorides can also be etched using oxidation and fluorination reactions. The ΔG°v alues for the oxidation of Ti, Ta, Nb, V, W, Mo, and Cr using O 3 to form TiO 2 , Ta 2 O 5 , Nb 2 O 5 , V 2 O 5 , WO 3 , MoO 3 , and CrO 3 are -288, -323, -305, -264, -296, -273, and -234 kcal/mol at 250 °C, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The oxidation reaction is expected to form a self-passivating metal oxide on the surface of the metal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> If the oxide layer does not self-limit versus oxidant exposure, other milder oxidation reactants such as NO 2 , 42 N 2 O, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and NO <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> may be useful to obtain a self-limiting oxide thickness. These metal oxides should then form volatile metal fluorides after fluorination with HF or SF 4 .</p><p>The choice of the fluorination reactant is important for metal ALE using oxidation and fluorination reactions. Some metals will spontaneously etch with fluorination reactants that are stronger than HF. For example, XeF 2 and F 2 are both strong fluorination reagents. After removing the metal oxide, XeF 2 and F 2 could proceed to etch the underlying metal spontaneously. For example, XeF 2 spontaneously etches Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and metal alloys such as Ti/W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> In contrast, HF can often etch the metal oxide layer without etching the underlying metal. Some metals will also be difficult to etch using oxidation and fluorination reactions because their metal oxides are not favorable or stable. For example, Re and Pt have volatile fluorides such as ReF 6 and PtF 6 , respectively. Re ALE may be difficult because the thermochemistry for fluorination of ReO 3 is not very favorable. The reaction ReO 3 (s) + 3 / 2 SF 4 (g) → ReF 6 (g) + 3 / 2 SO 2 (g) has a ΔG°value of +9 kcal/mol at 250 °C and becomes negative at &gt;450 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Pt ALE may also be difficult because PtO 3 is not a stable oxide. The formation of PtO 2 on Pt may be possible, but PtF 4 is not volatile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> IV. CONCLUSIONS Thermal ALE of TiN can be accomplished using sequential oxidation and fluorination reactions that yield volatile metal fluorides. This work employed two oxidation reagents, O 3 and H 2 O 2 , for the oxidation reaction. HF derived from HF-pyridine solution was then used for the fluorination reaction. TiN ALE occurred with a linear reduction of the TiN film thickness versus the number of ALE cycles. The etch rate of TiN ALE versus temperature using O 3 and HF as the reactants increased from 0.06 Å/cycle at 150 °C to 0.20 Å/cycle at 250 °C. The etch rate was then constant at ≥250 °C.</p><p>The selective etching of TiN was also observed in the presence of other materials using O 3 and HF as the reactants.</p><p>Table 1.

TiN ALE was also achieved using H 2 O 2 and HF as the reactants. An etch rate of 0.15 Å/cycle was measured at 250 °C. TiN ALE led to surface smoothing when using either O 3 or H 2 O 2 as the oxidation reactant.</p><p>The overall etching reaction is believed to follow the following reaction: TiN + 3O 3 + 4HF → TiF 4 + NO + 3O 2 + 2H 2 O. In the proposed reaction mechanism, the oxidizing reactant, O 3 , oxidizes TiN and forms a TiO 2 layer on the TiN substrate. The HF exposure then removes the TiO 2 layer by producing volatile TiF 4 and H 2 O from TiO 2 . The ALE of many other metal nitrides should be possible using the oxidation and fluorination reactions that yield a volatile metal fluoride. This ALE reaction mechanism should also be applicable for the ALE of metal carbides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, and elemental metals.</p></div>
