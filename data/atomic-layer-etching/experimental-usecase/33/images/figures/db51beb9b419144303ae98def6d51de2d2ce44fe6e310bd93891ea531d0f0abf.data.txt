| Process Step | Description |
|---|---|
| Native oxide | Initial state of TiN surface with native oxide layer |
| HF exposure with IR annealing | HF exposure followed by IR annealing to modify the surface |
| Surface modification and desorption | Cl2 plasma treatment leads to surface modification and desorption process |
