The line charts depict the thickness change (in nm) of TiO2 and ZrO2 samples treated with different chemical reagents (WF6, BCl3, SOCl2, TiCl4) at various temperatures. The x-axis represents the doses of the reagent, while the y-axis shows the thickness change. Each temperature is represented by a different color and marker.
