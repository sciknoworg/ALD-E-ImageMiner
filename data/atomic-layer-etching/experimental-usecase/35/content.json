        "text": "Recent advances in the semiconductor industry have created an exigency for processes that allow to deposit and etch material in conformal matter in three- dimensional devices. While conformal deposition is achieved using atomic layer deposition (ALD), conformal etching can be accomplished by thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) which, like ALD, proceeds via a binary sequence of self- limiting reactions. This study explores ALE of  $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$  using  $\\mathrm{WF}_{6}$  as a fluorinating agent, and  $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$ ,  $\\mathrm{TiCl}_{4}$ , or  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_{2}$  as a co- reactant. The effect of co- reactant chemistry was studied using atomic force microscopy, in situ ellipsometry, and in vacuo Auger electron spectroscopy measurements along with thermodynamic modeling. All three co- reactants exhibited saturation and etch rates increasing with temperature. At  $170^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  can be etched using  $\\mathrm{WF}_{6}$  with  $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$ ,  $\\mathrm{TiCl}_{4}$ , or  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_{2}$ , and the etching proceeds at 0.24, 0.18, and  $0.20 \\mathrm{nm / cycle}$ , respectively. At  $325^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$  ALE can occur using these same reactants, proceeding at 0.96, 0.74, and  $0.13 \\mathrm{nm / cycle}$ , respectively. A higher temperature is needed for  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$  ALE versus  $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  because the  $\\mathrm{ZrCl}_{4}$  product is less volatile than the corresponding  $\\mathrm{TiO}_{4}$ . During  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$  and  $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  etching using  $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$  or  $\\mathrm{TiCl}_{4}$ , boron oxide or titanium oxide intermediate layers, respectively, were formed on the surface, and they were subsequently removed by  $\\mathrm{WF}_{6}$ . In contrast, for ALE of  $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$  using  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_{2}$ , a similar intermediate layer is not observed. This study broadens the understanding of co- etchants role during thermal ALE and expands the range of reactants that can be used for vapor etching of metal oxides.",

This is done, for example, to etch trenches, shape via holes, or create patterns. While wet etching methods were historically used for microfabrication, continuous device miniaturization has limited their use due to their isotropic nature and hard to control etch rates. As such, dry etching technologies are mainly used in advanced processes due to their more precise feature size control and capability to achieve higher aspect ratios. Dry etching technologies include processes that employ physical etching (such as reactive ion etching, sputter etching, or ion milling) or chemical etching [chemical vapor etching (CVE), atomic layer etching].",

In addition to  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  CVE of other materials, such as  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$ $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  have been reported using  $\\mathrm{WF}_6$ $\\mathrm{HF / Sn(acac)_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{O_2 / hch}$  respectively. However, chemical vapor etching of many materials is limited due to the formation of metal fluorides or other species that are nonvolatile at the reaction temperature. This has enabled the development of atomic layer etching, ALE, which is a self- limiting two- step process. The ALE sequence involves a surface modification step followed by a removal step, where either step can be driven by thermal reactions or by plasma treatment and/or ion bombardment.

The processes are characterized using in situ ellipsometry, in vacuo AES, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicate that while all three chlorinating precursors lead to ALE of  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  the reaction byproducts differ, leading to distinct etch rates and temperature windows. Previously,  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_2$  has been shown to etch TiN.49 Although  $\\mathrm{WF}_6 / \\mathrm{BCl}_3$  are known to enable ALE of  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  the drawback of using  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  is that the reaction results in a solid  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  layer, which can be removed by subsequent  $\\mathrm{WF}_6$  exposure.

Also analogous to the reaction on  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$ , at  $\\mathrm{T} > 200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ,  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  reacting with  $\\mathrm{WF}_6$  is expected to yield gaseous  $\\mathrm{WO}_2\\mathrm{F}_2$  [reaction (7)]. However, unlike the reaction on  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$ , the resulting  $\\mathrm{ZrF_4}$  is expected to remain solid at all temperatures studied. At temperatures above about  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , exposing  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  to  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  or  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_2$  [reactions (8) and (10)] produces volatile  $\\mathrm{ZrCl_4}$ . For  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_2$  at  $\\mathrm{T} > 200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , the chlorination of  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  also yields volatile  $\\mathrm{SO}_2$  [reaction (10)]. Therefore, exposing  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  to  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_2$  at  $\\mathrm{T} > 200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  is expected to lead to spontaneous chemical vapor etching. In contrast, exposing  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  to  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  [reaction (8)] forms solid  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ , and this solid layer is expected to inhibit continuous etching of  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ .

In contrast to  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  all co- etchants led to the formation of solid species on  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  after exposure.  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  resulted in  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ $\\mathrm{TiCl_4}$  in  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{SOCl}_2$  in  $\\mathrm{Zr(SO_4)_2}$  at  $325^{\\circ}C$  While the resulting layers are removed by subsequent  $\\mathrm{WF}_6$  exposure, they could be undesirable reaction products when complete removal of the film is not desired. As such, co- reactant selection strongly affects the purity of the final sample depending on the metal oxide being etched. The results illustrate the importance of the co- reactant design during thermal atomic layer etching processes depending on the target material to be etched, desired processing temperature range, and the substrate.",
