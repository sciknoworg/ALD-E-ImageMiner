The line chart illustrates the ion current (A) of different molecular ions (m/z) of TiF compounds at varying temperatures (°C). The ion currents for m/z 67 TiF, m/z 86 TiF2, m/z 105 TiF3, and m/z 124 TiF4 are plotted against temperature. The highest ion current is observed around 400°C for m/z 67 TiF.
