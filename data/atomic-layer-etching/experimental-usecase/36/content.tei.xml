<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The present study investigates the cyclic etching of TiO 2 with CF polymer deposition and removal. We find that C 4 F 8 plasma treatment forms a CF polymer deposition layer on the TiO 2 and a modified TiO 2 surface under the CF polymer layer. Subsequent O 2 plasma treatment removes the CF polymer and the modified layer at the same time. This sequence is repeated. Accordingly, the TiO 2 film is etched at a rate of 0.67 nm per cycle. The CF polymer and modified TiO 2 layer also form on the sidewall TiO 2 surface of a trench pattern. We realize the isotropic TiO 2 etching of a trench pattern having a high aspect ratio exceeding 40 adopting the cyclic C 4 F 8 and O 2 plasma process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Flash memory devices have changed from planar to threedimensional (3D) structures, comprising vertically stacked memory cells that require the formation of small and highaspect-ratio spaces, to meet market demands for increased storage capacity. In general, 3D flash memory has a plurality of holes formed by alternating layers of conducting and insulating materials. The conducting layers act as control gates. Memory cells form on the sidewalls of holes. A memory cell usually comprises a SiO 2 layer, Si 3 N 4 layer, and another SiO 2 layer as a gate dielectric, a charge trap layer, and a tunnel dielectric layer. These memory cell layers do not require insulation between control gates. However, some types of 3D memory require the insulation of memory cells. Such types of 3D memory require the recession of conducting materials after holes are formed for this purpose. Memory cell films are then deposited along the recessed regions and the sidewalls, and predetermined portions of the films are removed to provide insulation through isotropic etching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> A challenging requirement of 3D memory devices is to control the amount of etching of these films precisely. Moreover, the most difficult aspect of this process is that the amount of etching needs to be uniform from the top to the bottom of the high-aspect-ratio pattern. The memory cell films comprise various materials, such as W, TiN, Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , ZrO 2 , TiO 2 , Si, Si 3 N 4 , and SiO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref> Several studies have investigated isotropic atomic layer etching (ALE) to meet the demand for increased storage capacity in recent years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> These studies can be classified as those on wet ALE and those on thermal ALE.

These processes are the reverse of atomic layer deposition, which requires a high temperature exceeding 150 °C and a metal coreagent such as trimethylaluminum, tin acetylacetone, dimethylaluminum chloride, or silicon tetrachloride.

A lowtemperature process that can be realized preferentially with a conventional tool is thus needed.</p><p>In this paper, we report on an isotropic cycle etching of TiO 2 that can be realized at a low temperature of 60 °C using a conventional capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) reactive ion etching (RIE) tool.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental methods</head><p>A 10 nm thick amorphous TiO 2 blanket film was deposited on a 300 mm Si wafer through atomic layer deposition. We used tetrakis dimethyl amino titanium and O 3 as a precursor and oxidant, respectively. The process temperature of the atomic layer deposition was 200 °C. In addition to the blanket sample, we used two types of patterned sample having different aspect ratios. One was a SiO 2 line and space pattern with an aspect ratio 16.5. The 330 nm thick SiO 2 was deposited on 30 nm thick Si 3 N 4 and etched through RIE. We used spin-on-coat polymer film as the SiO 2 etching mask of the line and space pattern with a half-pitch of 40 nm. After the SiO 2 etching, the spin-on-coat film was removed through ashing. A 10 nm thick layer of TiO 2 was then deposited. The space after TiO 2 deposition was 20 nm. The other sample was a SiO 2 trench pattern with an aspect ratio of 46. The 3500 nm thick SiO 2 was deposited on a Si substrate and etched through RIE. We used amorphous carbon film with a slit width of 100 nm as the mask of the trench pattern. The carbon layer was removed after SiO 2 RIE. A 10 nm thick layer of TiO 2 was deposited and the space after the deposition was 80 nm. Etching experiments were carried out using a CCP RIE system (Tokyo Electron, Vesta-RBH). Radiofrequency (100 MHz) power was applied to the substrate to induce plasma. Conditions to which the TiO 2 film was exposed are listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Ellipsometry was adopted to measure the thickness of the TiO 2 blanket film and the etched amount of film was calculated from the thickness before and after the plasma treatments. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was adopted to measure the sidewall TiO 2 film thickness of the pattern samples. We also adopted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the bonding states of the blanket film surface and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to analyze the atomic composition of the sidewall film of the pattern samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head><p>3.1. TiO 2 etching with CF 4 plasma Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the amount of etching of the TiO 2 blanket film with CF 4 plasma. The plasma conditions were pressure of 1.3 Pa, 100 MHz radio-frequency power of 1000 W, a CF 4 gas flow rate of 100 sccm, and a substrate temperature of 60 °C. The etched amount increased linearly with the treatment time as expected and the etching rate was 12.5 nm min -1 . We next confirm the amount of etching of the sidewall TiO 2 film. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a) shows the cross-sectional TEM image of the line and space patterned sample with an aspect ratio of 16.5. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b) shows the cross-sectional TEM image after CF 4 plasma treatment for 30 s. The depth dependence of the sidewall TiO 2 film thickness before and after the CF 4 plasma treatment and the etched amount are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The depth is defined as being from the top of the pristine pattern. The deposited TiO 2 film thickness varies from 10.1 nm at a depth of 40 nm to 9.8 nm at a depth of 300 nm. The remaining TiO 2 film thickness after the plasma treatment increased from 7.5 nm at 40 nm to 8.3 nm at 300 nm. The etched amount therefore decreased from 2.6 nm at 40 nm to 1.5 nm at 300 nm. Woo et al. showed the mechanism of the etching of TiO 2 film with CF 4 plasma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref> They mentioned that the TiO 2 film reacted with F radicals from the CF 4 plasma because the Ti-F chemical bond is stronger than the Ti-O bond, and TiF x formed on the surface as a byproduct. The TiF x was removed by ion bombardment. We believe that the amount of F radical decreased from the top of the pattern to the bottom because the radicals having diffused from the plasma were consumed on the sidewall. This caused the dependence of the etched amount on the pattern depth, or aspect ratio. Therefore, to suppress this dependence, we considered it important to supply the same amount of F radicals regardless of the aspect ratio, and one method would be to use the CF polymer formed on the TiO 2 surface. We supposed the same amount of F radical could be provided from the CF polymer from top to bottom of the hole when etching with O 2 plasma. In this study, we used C 4 F 8 plasma to form the CF polymer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Blanket TiO 2 etching with cyclic C 4 F 8 and O 2 plasma</head><p>First, blanket TiO 2 etching was carried out with cyclic C 4 F 8 and O 2 plasma processing. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the cyclic number dependence of blanket TiO 2 etching with cyclic C 4 F 8 and O 2 plasma. Both treatment times were 30 s. The etched amount increased linearly with the number of cycles. The TiO 2 etched amount per cycle was 0.71 nm/cycle. We also confirmed the O 2 plasma did not etch the TiO 2 film. This result supports that F radicals from the CF polymer etched TiO 2 . We next confirm the dependence of the TiO 2 etched amount on the CF polymer thickness. We first measured CF polymer thicknesses for different C 4 F 8 plasma treatment times from cross-sectional SEM images. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows that the thickness increased linearly with the treatment time. We then measured the TiO 2 etched amounts for the different CF polymer thicknesses. The TiO 2 etched amounts were 0.74 and 0.80 nm when the CF polymer thicknesses were 13.6 and 27.6 nm, respectively. The O 2 plasma treatment time was 30 s and there was one cycle. These results indicate that the TiO 2 etched amount was constant even if the thickness of the CF polymer formed on the film surface was different. We next analyze cross-sectional images after taken each step to investigate whether TiO 2 etching is constant regardless of the CF polymer thickness.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows TEM images as the TiO 2 was deposited [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows that there was a modified layer between the CF polymer and TiO 2 surface. The modified layer was removed with O 2 plasma treatment [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6(c)</ref>]. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> shows the TEM images after C 4 F 8 plasma treatment for 30 s [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>(a)] and 60 s [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7(b)</ref>]. The thickness of the modified layer after 60 s was the same as that after 30 s although the CF polymer after 60 s was thicker than that after 30 s. This shows that the modified layer thickness is constant regardless of the CF polymer thickness. We speculate that the TiO 2 surface is modified by CF radicals with ion bombardment and not with thermal energy from the stage. However, the thick CF polymer protects the surface from ions. Therefore, the modified layer is kept constant, although the CF polymer thickness increases. As a result, the TiO 2 etched amount is constant even if the CF polymer thickness changes. We then</p><p>Table I. Plasma exposure conditions of TiO 2 samples.

The sample after these plasma treatments had a single peak at around 684 eV related to F 1s, while the pristine sample did not [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8(b)</ref>]. This means that there was F residue on the surface after the plasma treatments. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>(c) shows the spectrum of C 1s. Both samples had two peaks at 284.8 and 288.9 eV, which    correspond to C-C and O-C=O bonds, respectively. These peaks are considered to be due to surface impurities. This result supports the finding that the F residue after the plasma treatments was not CF polymer. The spectrum of Ti 2p in the pristine sample had two peaks at 458.8 and 464.6 eV owing to the titanium atoms of TiO 2 [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8(a)</ref>], and the spectrum after the plasma treatments had two peaks at 459.1 and 464.9 eV. These peaks were also due to TiO 2 but they were slightly shifted to higher energy, which indicates Ti-F bonds on the surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref> The surface after the plasma treatments thus contained TiO 2 and TiF x . We speculate that the TiF x is the residue of the modified layer. We finally conducted thermal desorption spectroscopy after each step to investigate the detail of the modified layer.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref> shows ion currents for mass-to-charge ratios of 67, 86, 105, and 124, which respectively correspond to TiF, TiF 2 , TiF 3 , and TiF 4 . The spectroscopies of TiF and TiF 3 had two peaks at 350 °C and 460 °C while TiF 2 and TiF 4 had a single peak at 350 °C. We believe that there were two types of titanium fluoride. One had a desorption peak at 350 °C and dissociated into TiF, TiF 2 , TiF 3 , and TiF 4 in the mass spectrometer. The other had a peak at 450 °C and dissociated into TiF and TiF 3 [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9(a)</ref>]. There were no peaks of these except for TiF in the sample after the O 2 plasma treatment [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9(b)</ref>]. The TiF peak count was 1.78 × 10 -13 A having decreased from 1.00 × 10 -12 A after the C 4 F 8 plasma treatment. These results show that the modified layer that formed in the C 4 F 8 plasma was titanium fluorides and most of it was etched away with O 2 plasma. We finally confirm that the etched amount depends on the stage temperatures in the C 4 F 8 plasma step and O 2 plasma step.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">10</ref> shows the blanket TiO 2 etched amount for different stage temperatures in each step. We first decreased the temperature of the C 4 F 8 plasma step from 60 °C to 20 °C, while the O 2 plasma step had a temperature of 60 °C. The etched amount per cycle in the C 4 F 8 plasma step at 20 °C was 0.63 nm/cycle, which was almost same as that at 60 °C. We then decreased the temperature in the O 2 plasma step from 60 °C to 20 °C, while the C 4 F 8 plasma step had a temperature of 60 °C. The etched amount per cycle in the O 2 plasma step at 20 °C was 0.24 nm/cycle, which was lower than that at 60 °C. These results show that the thickness of the modified layer formed in the C 4 F 8 plasma step does not depend on the temperature, while the etched amount of the modified layer in the O 2 plasma step does. This is consistent with the results of thermal desorption spectroscopy. However, the calculated vapor pressure of TiF 4 at 60 °C was 0.14 Pa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref> which was lower than the pressure of the O 2 plasma of 13.3 Pa by a factor of 95. We therefore believe that the etching reaction is assisted by ion bombardment in the O 2 plasma treatment.</p><p>On the basis of the above results, we suggest the TiO 2 etching mechanism of the cyclic process shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">11</ref>. First, the C 4 F 8 plasma modifies the surface of the TiO 2 and formed TiF, TiF 2 , TiF 3 , and TiF 4 [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">11(a</ref>  This section reports on the application of the cyclic process to a sidewall TiO 2 film on a line pattern.</p><p>First, we measured the profile of the film composition to study the surface state of the sidewall TiO 2 film after the C 4 F 8 plasma treatment. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">12(a)</ref> shows the TEM image of the pattern sample after C 4 F 8 plasma treatment for 30 s.  © 2021 The Japan Society of Applied Physics 036001-4 The Ti increases from below 1% at 2 nm to above 20% at 8 nm as the Si decreases from above 25% to below 1% in both Figs. 12(b) and 12(c). We believe that the boundary between the SiO 2 and TiO 2 film was at about 5 nm. Meanwhile, the boundary between the TiO 2 film and CF polymer is unclear in both the upper portion [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">12(b)</ref>] and lower portion [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">12(c)</ref>]. In both portions, Ti decreased from above 20% at 20 nm to below 1% at 25 nm, C increased from below 3% at 15 nm to above 80% at 24 nm, and F was above 3% in the range from 14 to 22 nm. Therefore, there were Ti, C, and F in the range from 15 to 20 nm. This means that TiO 2 film and CF polymer were mixed at the boundary     regardless of the depth. We believe from these that the sidewall surface was modified by C 4 F 8 plasma treatment, the same as for the blanket surface.</p><p>Second, we etched the sidewall TiO 2 film on a trench pattern with an aspect ratio of 46. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">13(a)</ref> shows the TEM image of the trench pattern sample as TiO 2 was deposited. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">13(b</ref>)-13(d) shows enlargements of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">13</ref>(a) at the top, a 1400 nm depth from the top, and the bottom, respectively. We used two O 2 plasma treatment times in the cyclic process. One was 30 s and the other was 60 s. The C 4 F 8 plasma treatment time and the number of cycles were held constant at 30 s and eight cycles, respectively. TEM images after the cyclic process with O 2 plasma for 30 s are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">13(e</ref>)-13(g) while those for 60 s are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">13(h</ref>)-13(j). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">14</ref> shows the thickness of sidewall TiO 2 as deposited and after the cyclic processes. The etched amounts were 0.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.5, 3.1, and 4.2 nm at the top of the pattern, a depth of 700 nm from the top, a depth of 1400 nm, a depth of 2100 nm, a depth of 2800 nm, and the bottom, respectively. The sidewall TiO 2 at the top was not etched and the average etched amount except at the top was 3.5 nm. The amount increased with an increase in the O 2 plasma treatment time from 30 to 60 s. The etched amounts after 60 s were 2.9, 4.3, 4.2, 5.1, 4.3, and 4.0 nm, respectively; i.e. the top sidewall TiO 2 was etched by 2.9 nm and the average etched amount except at the top was 4.4 nm. We believe that O 2 plasma treatment for insufficient time cannot remove the CF polymer completely. The remaining CF polymer then prevents the modified TiO 2 from being removed. Consequently, the etched amount increases with the O 2 plasma treatment time. Furthermore, the CF polymer thickness at the top is greater than that of the sidewall in the trench as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>(a), which results in a smaller amount of etching at the top.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>Cycle etching of TiO 2 was performed using C 4 F 8 and O 2 plasma. We confirmed that C 4 F 8 plasma formed a CF polymer layer on TiO 2 and a modified TiO 2 layer under the CF polymer, and most of the modified layer was removed by the following O 2 plasma treatment. We believe that the modified layer comprises several types of titanium fluoride, and they do not desorb from the surface in the C 4 F 8 plasma step because of their low vapor pressure and the CF polymer formed on the modified layer. In addition, the desorption  amount of the modified layer in the O 2 plasma step depends on temperature, and we can thus control the etched amount per cycle using the temperature of the step. The cyclic process of these two steps successfully etched TiO 2 and the etching amount increased in proportion to the number of cycles. The etch rate was 0.67 nm/cycle. We also confirmed uniform sidewall etching of TiO 2 film formed on a trench patterned sample with an aspect ratio of 46. We believe that the C 4 F 8 and O 2 plasma cyclic process is a promising way to etch a sidewall uniformly in futuregeneration 3D devices.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(a)], after C 4 F 8 plasma treatment [Fig. 6(b)], and after O 2 plasma treatment [Fig. 6(c)]. Both plasma treatment times were 30 s. The TiO 2 thickness increased from 10.1 nm as TiO 2 was deposited to 10.5 nm after C 4 F 8 plasma treatment, and then decreased to 9.4 nm after O 2 plasma treatment. This means that TiO 2 was not etched by C 4 F 8 plasma but etched by O 2 plasma. The sample after C 4 F 8 plasma treatment [Fig. 6(b)]</figDesc></figure>

The CF polymer therefore forms on the titanium fluorides [Fig. 11(b)]. Consequently, the CF polymer suppresses further modification and formation of titanium fluorides. O radicals and ions in the O 2 plasma remove the CF polymer and TiF 2 , TiF 3 , and TiF 4 [Figs. 11(c), 11(d)].
