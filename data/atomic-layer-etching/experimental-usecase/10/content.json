        "text": "Atomic layer etching (ALE) is required to fabricate the complex 3D structures for future integrated circuit scaling. To enable ALE for a wide range of materials, it is important to discover new processes and subsequently understand the underlying mechanisms. This work focuses on an isotropic plasma ALE process based on hexafluoroacetylacetone (Hhfac) doses followed by  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  plasma exposure. The ALE process enables accurate control of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  film thickness with an etch rate of  $0.16 \\pm 0.02$  nm per cycle, and an ALE synergy of  $98\\%$ . The ALE mechanism is investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Different diketone surface bonding configurations are identified on the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface, suggesting that there is competition between etching and surface inhibition reactions. During the Hhfac dosing, the surface is etched before becoming saturated with monodentate and other hfac species, which forms an etch inhibition layer.  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  plasma is subsequently employed to remove the hfac species, cleaning the surface for the next half- cycle. On planar samples no residue of the Hhfac etchant is observed by FTIR after  $\\mathrm{H}_2$  plasma exposure. DFT analysis indicates that the chelate configuration of the diketone molecule is the most favorable surface species, which is expected to leave the surface as volatile etch product. However, formation of the other configurations is also energetically favorable, which explains the buildup on an etch inhibiting layer. The ALE process is thus hypothesized to work via an etch inhibition and surface cleaning mechanism. It is discussed that such a mechanism enables thickness control on the sub- nm scale, with minimal contamination and low damage.",

One of the challenges for the use of such a process in device fabrication is contamination of the surface after ALE, either because of incomplete removal of the modified layer leaving behind an oxyfluoride surface, or because the metal etchant molecule introduces undesired metal atoms to the sample surface.16 Additionally, high halide exposure can impact stability/performance of reactors, which then requires cleaning,",

        "text": "A group of molecules that is being researched as the etchant for ligand- addition ALE is diketones. The general structure of a diketone molecule is shown in Fig. 2(a). The modification and ligand- addition chemistry with diketones is effective for ALE of metallic films, where typically the first half- cycle is an oxidation or chlorination step to change the oxidation state from the zero state. Once the metal atom is in a higher oxidation state, volatile species can be formed by chelation (i.e. forming two coordinate bonds with a metal atom) in the second halfcycle.8,10,13,27- 29 Furthermore, diketones are tunable molecules, and by adjusting R groups as shown in Fig. 2, the etch rate or selectivity could be tailored in three ways: (i) larger R- groups limit the density of molecules that can bind on the surface due to steric effects.30 (ii) More/less electrophilic R- groups affect how strongly bound the H of the hydroxyl group is, adjusting how acidic the molecule behaves.30- 32 (iii) The volatility of the diketone can be enhanced by increasing intermolecular repulsion between the R- groups, which may promote higher etch rates and lower operating temperatures due to formation of more volatile reaction products.30,33 Previously, diketones have been researched as atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor ligands, as chemical etchants for metal oxide films, and as inhibitor molecules for area- selective ALD (AS- ALD).7,8,27,33- 43 This large knowledge base can be leveraged to better understand the surface reactions and mechanism for ALE, and to identify materials for which an ALE process will be viable. Previous AS- ALD work has shown that diketones preferentially react with alkaline OH groups on surfaces, and do not readily react with acidic OH groups, potentially helping to predict selectivity of a diketone ALE process.36,38,44,45 Additionally, diketones can bind to surfaces in multiple configurations.44 For AS- ALD, the different surface bonding configurations were found to play an important role in determining the effectiveness of precursor blocking.36,44",

The angle of the butterfly valve in the APC is automatically adjusted such that the pressure in the chamber is maintained at a set value. Use of an APC enables high chamber pressures with low gas flows, which helps maximize residence time of reactant species.34,53 Hhfac (Sigma- Aldrich,  $98\\%$  ) was held in a stainless- steel bubbler at room temperature and then vapor- drawn into the reaction chamber.

The hold step is implemented to increase the exposure of the etchant Hhfac to the surface and facilitate the etching reaction. To prevent backflow of the Hhfac into the ICP tube during the hold step, there is a constant 10 sccm Ar flow through the ICP tube. As such, the butterfly valve remains partially open, leading to some of the Hhfac being pumped away during the hold step.

To achieve a hydroxylated  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  (0001) surface, the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface is partially hydroxylated by locating hydroxyl groups on all 9 top layer Al atoms, resulting in a 1 monolayer OH coverage (corresponding to  $5.1\\mathrm{OHnm}^{- 2}$ ). This is slightly less than the experimentally observed value of  $7.1\\mathrm{OHnm}^{- 2}$ ,65 which is due to the difference between an amorphous surface and the perfectly crystalline surface employed for simulations. In order to balance the negative charge from the addition of OH, 9 out of the 18 exposed O atoms neighboring the top layer Al atoms are hydrogenated. The bottom two  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  layers were kept frozen at their bulk positions. More than 20 different starting configurations were studied for the Hhfac adsorption of which the resulting unique configurations are reported here.

Based on the DFT simulations this is likely due to the de- protonation of the Hhfac, which forms volatile  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  at the surface. Therefore, saturation of the Hhfac adsorption could occur once all the surface OH groups are consumed.

From  $80~\\mathrm{ms}$  to  $500~\\mathrm{ms}$  of total Hhfac dosing time, the hfac absorbance increases without any change in the OH absorbance, suggesting that OH groups are not vital for hfac adsorption.

Removal of Al atoms from the surface is thought to occur predominately during the initial doses of Hhfac, before the formation of the surface inhibition layer. In the first Hhfac doses, the adsorbed hfac species measured on the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface by FTIR are primarily in monodentate configuration. The initially high monodentate coverage is surprising considering that the simulations reported in this work and in AS- ALD literature suggest that the chelate configuration should be the most favorable surface species.36 This observation can be explained by a survivorship bias towards the monodentate configuration. On the initial  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface, hfac can easily bind in the preferred chelate configuration and volatilize surface Al atoms, thereby leaving the surface and not appearing in the FTIR spectra.7,27 Some hfac species may bind in monodentate configuration as steric effects prevent them from transitioning into the chelate configuration (Fig. 12(c) and (d)), or they bind directly in monodentate through the less energetically favorable path (Fig. 13). As the surface becomes more crowded, steric hindrance will be more pronounced, and more Hhfac species will bind to the surface in monodentate configuration. Each Hhfac pulse adds more hfac in monodentate configuration to the surface, until the surface is saturated with monodentate bound hfac, which enables self- limitation of the Hhfac half- cycle. Additionally, some hfac species may bind in chelate configuration, but are surrounded by hfac ligands in monodentate configuration. Due to steric effects the monodentate ligands cannot transition into the chelate configuration. These isolated chelate species will not be able to form volatile Al- containing species as it is anticipated at least two chelate bound hfac ligands are required to make a volatile product. Thus, some chelate hfac ligands can contribute to the surface inhibition. Decomposition of the Hhfac into ketene structures may further contribute to the surface inhibition, accelerating the self- limiting behavior. These structures are not expected to be driving the mechanism as they only constituent a small part of the FTIR signal (Fig. 9). Taken together, it is hypothesized that during the Hhfac dose there is a competition between the etching and surface inhibition reaction.33,44",
