The chart shows the relationship between the number of Hhfac pulses and EPC (a), as well as the relationship between Hâ‚‚ plasma exposure time and EPC (b). Both relationships appear to follow a curve, indicating that EPC increases with increasing number of pulses and exposure time, reaching a plateau at higher values.
