The proposed ALE process led to excellent self- limiting etch characteristics with a low direct current (DC) self- bias, which resulted in a high linearity between the etching depth and number of cycles. The etching damage was evaluated using several methods, including atomic force microscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the  $I - V$  properties of the recessed Schottky diodes were compared with those of digital etching performed using  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma and HCl solution. The electrical characteristics of the recessed Schottky diode fabricated using the proposed ALE process were superior to those of the diodes fabricated using the conventional digital etching process. Moreover, the ALE process yielded a higher PL intensity and  $\\mathrm{N / (Al + Ga)}$  ratio of the etched AlGaN surface, along with a smoother etched surface.",

        "text": "GaN- based high electron mobility transistors have been developed for use in high- frequency amplifiers and high- voltage power switching applications owing to their high breakdown voltage, large bandgap, and high electron carrier velocity [1]. In terms of device fabrication, GaN- related materials including AlGaN are physically and chemically stable, and thus, plasma etching is a typical technique to realize the etching of (Al)GaN. The etching process considerably influences the device characteristics, especially in cases in which the etch depth must be precisely controlled, and/or the plasma- induced damage must be minimized. For example, the current level and dynamic current collapse characteristics of recessed gate structures in field- effect transistors [2- 4] or diodes [5- 7] are considerably dependent on the recess depth and trap states at the etched surface. Although conventional plasma- etching methods, such as reactive ion etching (RIE) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP)- RIE [8- 11], are still being widely used, a digital etching process involving the  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma oxidation of (Al)GaN in conjunction with  $\\mathrm{HCl:H_2O}$  solution- based oxide removal has received considerable attention owing to the associated low etching damage and easy control of the recess depth. However, this process is labor- intensive due to the combination of the plasma oxidation and wet etching processes and involves a low etch rate [12]. In this context, the realization of an atomic layer etching (ALE) process, which is an in situ digital etching process and has relatively high etch rates with low etching damage [13- 16], is desirable. To exploit the advantages of the ALE process, the process conditions must be optimized to minimize the plasma- induced etching damage and to attain self- limiting characteristics to precisely control the etch depth.",

The ideality factor in the low forward bias region is an indicator for the trap- assisted recombination. As shown in Figure 8b, the slope of the forward bias region was not uniform for the digital etching case, which resulted in non- uniform ideality factor behavior in Figure 8d. On the other hand, the ALE case exhibited more uniform and lower ideality factor behavior at the low bias region. Therefore, it is suggested that the plasma- induced damage caused by the ALE process is less than that caused by the digital etching process. The increase in the ideality factor at the high forward bias region in Figure 8d is due to the fact that the diode current does not increase exponentially with the applied voltage [22,23]. The ideality factor determined at applied voltages of 0.1 to  $0.3\\mathrm{V}$  was  $\\sim 1.1$  and 1.8- 2.5 for the diodes fabricated using the ALE and digital etching, respectively.

        "text": "4. ConclusionsALE using  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$  plasma in an ICP-RIE system was developed to realize a self-limiting etching process with low etching damage. The ALE process conditions for the  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma step were as follows: ICP power of  $400\\mathrm{W},$  bias power of  $3\\mathrm{W},$  chamber pressure of 50 mTorr, DC self-bias of  $4\\mathrm{V},$  and plasma time of  $60\\mathrm{s}$ . The ALE process conditions for the  $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$  plasma step included ICP power of  $400\\mathrm{W},$  bias power of  $2\\mathrm{W},$  chamber pressure of  $10\\mathrm{mTorr},$  DC self-bias of  $3.8\\mathrm{V},$  and plasma time of  $45\\mathrm{s},$  which resulted in the etch rate of  $0.7\\mathrm{nm}$  /cycle. The etching damage was investigated using various evaluation methods including AFM,  $\\mathrm{PL},$  and XPS, and the  $I - V$  characteristics of recessed Schottky diodes were compared to those obtained using a conventional digital etching process using  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma oxidation and HCl-solution-based oxide removal. The ALE using  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{BCl_3}$  plasma led to better electrical characteristics of the Schottky diodes, as well as higher PL intensity, increased  $\\mathrm{N / (Al + Ga)}$  ratio, and a smoother etched surface compared with those of the conventional digital etching process using  $\\mathrm{O_2}$  plasma and HCl solution. In addition, the ALE technique exhibited excellent self-limiting characteristics and ensured a high linearity between the etch depth and number of cycles. The proposed ALE process was noted to be promising to be applied for (Al)GaN etching, in which the precise control of the etch depth and low etching damage are necessary.",
