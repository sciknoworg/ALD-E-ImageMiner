The use of ultra- thin gate dielectrics, ultra thin channels, and sub- 20 nm film thicknesses in field effect transistors and other devices requires near- atomic scale etching control and selectivity. There is an emerging consensus that as critical dimensions approach the sub- 10 nm scale, the need for an etching method corresponding to Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), i.e. Atomic Layer Etching (ALE), has become essential, and that the more than 30- year quest to complement/replace continuous directional plasma etching (PE) methods for critical applications by a sequence of individual, self- limited surface reaction steps has reached a crucial stage. A key advantage of this approach relative to continuous PE is that it enables optimization of the individual steps with regard to reactant adsorption, self- limited etching, selectivity relative to other materials, and damage of critical surface layer. In this overview we present basic approaches to ALE of materials, discuss similarities/crucial differences relative to thermal and plasma- enhanced ALD, and then review selected results on ALE of materials aimed at pattern transfer. The overview concludes with a discussion of opportunities and challenges ahead.",

The reviews $^{36 - 38}$  describe key features of plasma- enhanced ALD, and differences relative to thermal ALD. Plasma- assisted ALD offers greater processing flexibility relative to thermal ALD, including a larger number of precursors that may be used; the opportunity to use lower substrate temperatures than possible in thermal ALD while maintaining growth per cycle, and an increased range of materials that may be deposited along with control of materials properties. One limitation of plasma- assisted ALD is reduced conformality (step coverage) relative to thermal ALD when coating substrates with pronounced surface topography, $^{36}$  e.g. high aspect ratio trenches or holes. This is explained by the highly reactive species created in the plasma environment which make the achievement of self- limitation more difficult, i.e. it has been observed that deposition on passivated surfaces can take place more easily in the plasma environment. $^{36,39}$  The result is that process rates may become more strongly dependent on the locally available chemical precursor flux, and may be controlled by radical recombination loss probabilities in deep trenches, $^{39}$  and/or energy flux, in contrast to ideal ALD processes. Profit et al. $^{36}$  also point out additional concerns for plasma- based ALD processes, e.g. vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) induced electrical damage to insulators which is absent in a purely thermal environment.

Both spontaneous chemical etching by the precursor and physical sputtering should be minimal. The concept of an ALE window located between the spontaneous chemical etching and the physical sputtering regimes is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 for ion- induced etching. The key parameter for ALE that plays a similar role as substrate temperature in thermal ALD is ion energy. In a similar fashion as there exists an ALD window versus substrate temperature, there is an ALE window versus ion energy. In a plasma environment, ions with an energy distribution are incident on the substrate and control physical sputtering and substrate damage extent. Bombardment of the surface between chemical reactant exposures at a sufficiently high fluence is assumed in Fig. 4. The modification of the surface by the precursor allows the material to be etched with lower activation energy as compared to the underlying material without modification. The presence of chemical reactants at the substrate surface along with ion bombardment induce a chemical reaction between the surface atoms and the precursor which causes etch products to boil off or sputter from the surface. This process enables directional etching of the material at ion energies above the chemically enhanced etching energy threshold  $E_{\\text{ceth}}$  and below the physical sputtering energy threshold  $E_{\\text{psth}}$ , respectively. By carefully tailoring the energy of ion bombardment, it is possible to control the etching depth to about a monolayer. Spontaneous chemical etching of the reactant/substrate system interferes with this approach and the thermal energy required to drive these reactions is made negligible by reducing the temperature of the substrate sufficiently. While Fig. 4 illustrates this concept for ion bombardment, in the literature ALE windows have also been demonstrated by using electron, fast neutral and photon bombardment of surfaces for directed energy input.",

        "text": "One key need driving development of ALE approaches is the achievement of atomic scale etching selectivity with regard to a different material. More generally, owing to the complex nature of surfaces in advanced semiconductor devices, simultaneous etching control over multiple materials is typically required. By working close to the energy threshold for physical sputtering of one material, and exploiting energy threshold differences among different materials, etching selectivity can be optimized. The threshold energy for physical sputtering  $E_{p s t h}$  depends on the nature of the material and is higher in the case of  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  than for Si,  $E_{p s t h}(S i O_{2}) > E_{p s t h}(S i)$  . By supplying chemical reactant to the substrate surface, chemically enhanced etching is possible, with an energy threshold  $E_{c e t h}(S i O_{2})$  that is lower than for physical sputtering  $E_{p s t h}(S i)$  , which may enable selective etching of  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  over Si. The amount of material etched per cycle will depend on the surface coverage of the chemical reactants up to a saturation coverage. In the schematic of Fig. 4 it is also assumed that in this ALE window between  $E_{c e t h}$  and  $E_{p s t h}$  the substrate thickness less per cycle is determined by the reactant coverage and essentially independent of ion energy, which does not need to be the case.",

They achieved about  $1 / 3\\mathrm{ML}$  etching per cycle. This work demonstrated clearly that the etching was limited by the adsorption of the chemical reactant. In related work they also evaluated surface activation using low energy Ar ion bombardment using an electron beam excited plasma.61,62 They published subsequently additional work using Ar ion bombardment,63 or photon irradiation of a chlorine- coated GaAs surface.44,64 Aoyagi et al.65 studied GaAs ALE using alternating  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  exposure and synchronized low energy  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  bombardment by applying a low bias voltage in an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma system. The ECR Ar discharge was continuously maintained, and  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  was admitted for times up to  $40~\\mathrm{s}$  to achieve adsorption of Cl atoms at the GaAs surface. They report self- limited etching of about a monolayer per cycle for a certain exposure time window of the substrate to the chlorine discharge and the low energy Ar ion beam. For extended exposure times (greater than  $20~\\mathrm{s}$  ),the etch depth per cycle decreased which they explained by multi- layer Cl adsorption. Ko et al.66 also examined layer- by- layer etching of GaAs, InP, GaInAs, and AlInAs using Cl radicals produced by a low power discharge and  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion bombardment (with additional RF bias) produced sequentially in an ECR system. For complete chlorine surface coverage of GaAs achieved by 6 s exposure to an  $\\mathrm{Ar / Cl}_2$  discharge at 1 mTorr they observed self- limited etching of about 5 A/cycle. For their approach they quote a typical cycle time of  $45\\mathrm{s}$  which consists of  $10~\\mathrm{s}$  reactive radical adsorption time, followed by pump out of excess radicals  $(30~\\mathrm{s})$  and a desorption time with Ar ions of  $5\\mathrm{s}$  .This shows the strong impact of the purge cycle on cycling time.

They argued that during actual device fabrication the switch to an ALE method would likely only be implemented after a conventional rapid plasma etching process had thinned the material to a few monolayers above the interface between materials. Such an approach could be realized using separate, dedicated plasma etching and ALE processing chambers.

        "text": "As critical dimensions of semiconductor devices approach the sub-  $10\\mathrm{nm}$  scale, the industrial need for an etching method capable of near- atomic resolution has led to a large increase in activity on novel directional etching methods based on a sequence of individual, self- limited surface reaction steps. The ability to achieve controlled, self- limited removal of various films at the Angstrom- level has been demonstrated for a range of reactant/materials systems, although specialized equipment with low throughput has often been used. Since for many situations true atomistic layer removal is not yet required and self- limited processing at the Angstrom scale appears sufficient, recent efforts have focused on increasing the speed with which self- limited surface reaction steps can be realized using plasma etching systems with enhanced temporal control of power, substrate biasing and gas delivery/pumping. A key challenge will be the insertion of ALE approaches into manufacturing. Since the overall energy content of ALE systems is expected to be significantly higher than for typical ALD systems, in particular if plasma is used during all reaction steps, this will produce a highly dynamic environment where species transport between different surfaces can easily take place. Maintaining controlled etching behavior for such systems within the ALE window near the energy threshold for physical sputtering is extremely challenging and will require stringent control of system cleanliness and the state of \"passive\" surfaces. These efforts are expected to benefit",
