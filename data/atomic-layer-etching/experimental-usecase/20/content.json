        "text": "ABSTRACT: Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of amorphous and crystalline aluminum nitride was performed using sequential exposures of hydrogen fluoride (HF) or xenon difluoride  $\\mathrm{(XeF_2)}$  as the fluorination reactant and boron trichloride  $\\mathrm{(BCl_3)}$  as the ligand- exchange reactant. The expected fluorination reactions are  $\\mathrm{AlN} + 3\\mathrm{HF}(\\mathrm{g})\\rightarrow$ $\\mathrm{AlF}_3 + \\mathrm{NH}_3(\\mathrm{g})$  and  $\\mathrm{AlN} + 1.5\\mathrm{XeF}_2\\rightarrow \\mathrm{AlF}_3 + \\mathrm{NF}_3(\\mathrm{g}) + 1.5\\mathrm{Xe}(\\mathrm{g})$  . The expected complete ligand- exchange reaction is  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3 + \\mathrm{BCl}_3(\\mathrm{g})\\rightarrow \\mathrm{BF}_3(\\mathrm{g}) + \\mathrm{AlCl}_3(\\mathrm{g})$  . The HF fluorination reactant together with  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  could etch amorphous AlN films deposited using AlN atomic layer deposition (ALD). The  $\\mathrm{XeF}_2$  fluorination reactant together with  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  was required to etch crystalline AlN. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to study the growth of AlN ALD using tris(dimethylamido)aluminum and ammonia as the reactants. Thermal AlN ALE of the AlN ALD films with HF and  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  as the reactants was then monitored using FTIR spectroscopy. The etching of the AlN ALD films occurred at temperatures greater than  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  The change of the spectral features versus HF and  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  exposures was consistent with a ligand- exchange etching mechanism for AlN thermal ALE. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used to measure the thermal ALE of crystalline AlN using  $\\mathrm{XeF}_2$  and static exposures of  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  . The crystalline AlN displayed etch rates that varied with temperature from  $0.19\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle at  $212^{\\circ}C$  to  $0.93\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle at  $298^{\\circ}C$  The etch rates were dependent on both the static  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  exposure and the  $\\mathrm{XeF}_2$  exposure. Consistent etch rates could be obtained by controlling the time or number of reactant exposures. X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were consistent with aluminum fluoride  $\\mathrm{(AlF_3)}$  being formed during the  $\\mathrm{XeF}_2$  exposure and subsequently removed after the  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  exposure. Quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) was also used to identify the volatile etch products during the reaction of  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  with  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  . These QMS investigations observed  $\\mathrm{AlCl}_3$  as the etch product and  $\\mathrm{BCl}_x\\mathrm{F}_y$  ligand- exchange products. The temperature dependence of the  $\\mathrm{AlCl}_3$  etch products and  $\\mathrm{BCl}_x\\mathrm{F}_y$  ligand- exchange products revealed that the ligand- exchange products appeared at temperatures below the onset of the  $\\mathrm{AlCl}_3$  etch products at  $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  was also utilized together with  $\\mathrm{XeF}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{BCl}_3$  to attempt to remove Cl and F from the AlN surface either during or after AlN ALE. XPS studies revealed that a final large  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  exposure after AlN ALE was most effective at Cl and F removal.",
