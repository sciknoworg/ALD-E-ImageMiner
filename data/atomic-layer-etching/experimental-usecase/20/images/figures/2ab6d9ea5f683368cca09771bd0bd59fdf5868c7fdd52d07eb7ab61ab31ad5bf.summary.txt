The flowchart illustrates two chemical processes: fluorination and ligand-exchange. In fluorination, nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃) reacts with xenon (Xe) to form aluminum trifluoride (AIF₃) and aluminum nitride (AIN). In ligand-exchange, aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) and boron trifluoride (BF₃) react to etch a layer of aluminum nitride (AIN).
