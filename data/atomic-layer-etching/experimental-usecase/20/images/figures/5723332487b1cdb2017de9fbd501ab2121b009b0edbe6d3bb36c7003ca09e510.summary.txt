The chart shows the intensity of various ions (BCl₃⁺, BCIF₂⁺, BCl₂F⁺, BF₃⁺, AlCl₂⁺, AlCl₃⁺) as a function of temperature. The intensity of BCl₃⁺ and BCIF₂⁺ decreases with increasing temperature, while BF₃⁺ increases sharply above 300°C. AlCl₂⁺ and AlCl₃⁺ show a significant increase in intensity at higher temperatures.
