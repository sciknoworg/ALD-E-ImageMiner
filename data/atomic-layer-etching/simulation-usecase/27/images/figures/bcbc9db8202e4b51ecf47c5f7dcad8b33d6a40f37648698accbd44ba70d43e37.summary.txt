The timeline chart illustrates the sequence of gas flow rates and pressure settings during two half-cycles (A and B) in a process involving Ar, SF6, and TMA. Half-cycle A includes stabilizing Ar flow at 150 sccm, followed by a plasma phase with Ar/SF6 at 300 sccm, and ends with a purge. Half-cycle B starts with a short TMA dose hold at 10 sccm, followed by a TMA dose hold at 150 mTorr, and concludes with another purge.
