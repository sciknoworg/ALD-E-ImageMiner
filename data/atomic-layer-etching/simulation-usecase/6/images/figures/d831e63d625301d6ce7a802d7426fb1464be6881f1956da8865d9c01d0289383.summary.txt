The chart illustrates the etching depth of silicon (Si Etched) and chlorine uptake (Cl Uptake) as a function of species dosage (Cl₂ or Ar⁺/cm²). It shows that at a dosage of 25 × 10¹⁵, there is significant etching and chlorine uptake, while at 50 × 10¹⁵, the etching depth decreases and chlorine uptake increases.
