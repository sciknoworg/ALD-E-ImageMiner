The composition and structure of the near surface region change in both time and depth. Full understanding of this process requires resolving both temporal and spatial variations. In this work, we consider silicon (Si) atomic layer etching (ALE) by alternating exposure to chlorine gas  $(\\mathrm{Cl}_2)$  and argon ions  $(\\mathrm{Ar}^{+})$ . Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are compared to experimental measurements with the aim of better understanding the dynamics of ALE and to test the simulation procedure. The simulations help to more fully interpret the experimental measurements. Optical emission measured just above the surface being etched can be related to etch products and can, therefore, be directly compared to simulation predictions. The simulations capture the measured initial product distribution leaving the surface and match the measured etch per cycle reasonably well. While simulations demonstrate the importance of ion- induced surface damage and mixing into a layer below the surface, the depth of which depends mainly on ion energy, the experiments suggest there is more Cl mixed into the layer than the MD procedure predicts.",

The technique involves complex pulsing strategies with gas composition and plasma powers being altered sequentially. We focus here on ALE of silicon (Si) using chlorine chemistry (Cl) to modify the surface layer at atoms and argon ions  $(\\mathrm{Ar}^{+})$  to remove the chlorinated layer. $^{9 - 13}$  This system has also been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. $^{14 - 17}$  However, there have been few direct comparisons between experimental and MD studies. It is common for these thrusts to be performed separately, or for MD studies to refer to previous experimental results to validate simulation predictions. In this work, we aim to combine MD ALE simulations, similar to our previously published work, $^{16,17}$  with recent ALE and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) experiments $^{18}$  in order to better understand  $\\mathrm{Si - Cl}_2$ - Ar ALE. Direct comparison of simulation with measurements can both help test the assumptions used in the simulation and can also help interpret experimental measurements. In Si ALE with chlorine, the chlorination step can be performed using a chlorine plasma or with chlorine gas  $(\\mathrm{Cl}_2)$ .

Si (100) wafers (3 in. diameter) were mounded with double- sided carbon tape on a 3 in. diameter stainless steel holder.

The sample holders were moved in and out of the chamber through a vacuum load- lock. The DC self- bias potential with respect to ground potential was measured through rf- chokes. Cl gas flow, and powers to the ICP and substrate stage, applied through impedance- matching networks, were turned on and off under computer control.

An impact simulation is a MD trajectory that is run for approximately  $2 \\mathrm{ps}$  under the microcanonical ensemble (constant number of particles, volume, and energy). In these simulations, a semi- infinite slab of initially diamond- cubic  $\\mathrm{Si}$  is created with periodic boundaries imposed in the lateral  $x$  and  $y$  directions. The lattice spacing of the crystal corresponds to  $\\mathrm{Si}$  at  $300 \\mathrm{K}$ . The volume of the cell is  $32.60 \\times 32.60 \\times 54.34 \\mathrm{\\AA}^{3}$ . In this work, we will refer to one monolayer (ML) of fluence for a given species as  $1 \\times 10^{15}$  impacts of said species per  $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  to or from the surface. The (100) surface of the  $\\mathrm{Si}$  crystal is exposed to a vacuum space in the  $z$  direction. During the impact simulations, we place a  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecule or an  $\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$  (depending on whether we are in the process of modeling the chemical modification step or the ion bombardment step) at a random  $(x,y)$  position in the vacuum space above the cell. The molecule or ion is allowed to impact the surface of the cell. The velocities of the incoming species are assigned depending on whether they are described as \"thermal\" or \"energetic.\"  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules are \"thermal\" and their velocity components are assigned according to the Maxwell- Boltzmann distribution at  $300 \\mathrm{K}$ . Only  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules with a negative  $z$  velocity component are considered in order to ensure they hit the surface of the simulation cell.  $\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$  ions are \"energetic\" and only have a negative  $z$  velocity assigned based on the ion energy being simulated. Ions are assumed to neutralize before impact. Energetic  $\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$  is assumed to impact at purely normal incidence. Following the initiation of the particle trajectory toward the surface, the simulation runs for about  $2 \\mathrm{ps}$  after the impact. The bottom two layers of the  $\\mathrm{Si}$  slab are fixed so that the cell does not drift in the negative  $z$  direction. The depth of the cell is maintained such that incoming species do not interact with the fixed atoms at the bottom of the cell. After each impact simulation, a Beredensen thermostat $^{29}$  is applied to bring the simulation cell back to a set temperature. In this work, the set temperature is  $300 \\mathrm{K}$ . Also, etch products leaving the surface are identified at the end of each impact simulation. Previous reports $^{27,30}$  give details on the etch product identification routine. After two layers of  $\\mathrm{Si}$  atoms are etched, two more layers are added to the bottom of the cell.",

A single ALE cycle consists of a chemical modification step followed by an ion bombardment step. In the experiments that we are attempting to model with the MD simulations, the chlorination step is done by exposure to  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  gas for  $2 \\mathrm{s}$ , as noted above. If we refer to the specification given in Sec. II (2 s of  $20 \\mathrm{SCCMCl}_2$  flow at  $300 \\mathrm{K}$  and  $20 \\mathrm{mTorr}$  using a continuous Ar carrier gas flow of  $80 \\mathrm{SCCM}$ ), we can estimate the flux of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  impacting the surface. The mean velocity,  $\\nu_{m}$ , of the  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules are estimated to be  $3 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{cm / s}$ . From the ideal gas law, the number density of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$ ,  $\\nu_{Cl_2}$ , is  $1.3 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{Cl}_2 / \\mathrm{cm}^3$ . From the kinetic gas theory, the  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  flux to the  $\\mathrm{Si}$  substrate is given by  $\\frac{1}{4} \\nu_{m} n_{Cl_2} = 9.8 \\times 10^{17} \\mathrm{Cl}_2 / \\mathrm{cm}^3 \\mathrm{s}$ . With  $1 / 8$ $2 \\mathrm{s}$  exposure time, this corresponds to a fluence of  $2.94 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{Cl}_2 / \\mathrm{cm}^2$  (or  $2940 \\mathrm{ML}$  of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$ ). In the MD simulations, we model the chlorination step as 3000 thermal  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules impacts on a  $32.60 \\times 32.60 \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$  surface. This corresponds to a fluence of  $2.82 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules  $/ \\mathrm{cm}^2$  or roughly  $28.2 \\mathrm{ML}$  of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules. The simulated  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  fluence is, therefore, much lower than experimental  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  fluence; however, as will be shown in the supplementary material, $^{31}$  the simulated  $\\mathrm{Cl}$  surface coverage saturates by approximately  $30 \\mathrm{ML}$  of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  fluence. See the supplementary material $^{31}$  for surface flux and fluence calculations and explicit evidence that a larger  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  fluence will not result in more  $\\mathrm{Cl}$  uptake into the  $\\mathrm{Si}$  slab in the MD simulations. Therefore, to speed up computations, we use  $28.2 \\mathrm{ML}$  of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules for the chlorination step. However, it is important to note that the simulation time for the chlorination step is much shorter than the experimental chlorination step. As mentioned in the second paragraph of this section, each impact simulations last approximately  $2 \\mathrm{ps}$ . Therefore, the simulated time for the chlorination step is only about  $3 \\mathrm{ns}$ , orders of magnitude below the  $2 \\mathrm{s}$  experimental time. Due to the timestep of the MD simulations being on the order of  $1 \\mathrm{fs}$ , it is computationally intractable to directly simulate the experimental timescales.

The procedure used in the MD simulations, as detailed by Humbird, only explicitly simulates the roughly 2 ps impact when a species hits the surface. We then search for and delete etch products and thermostat the cell to  $300\\mathrm{K}$ . The next impact is then simulated with only about a few picoseconds (including the thermostat procedure) having been simulated since the previous impact. This procedure is adequate for simulating \"prompt\" processes like energetic ion impact, sputtering and dissociative adsorption of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$ . However, for the surface area we consider in the simulations, the time between  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  impacts with the surface is on the order of tens to hundreds of microseconds. It is possible that adsorbed Cl could be diffusing deeper into the Si substrate during these relatively long time scales. Unlike continuous plasma processes, the surfaces in ALE are not subject to ion bombardment for relatively long periods of time. It is also known, for example, that fluorine atoms often penetrate deeply into Si. Other studies show how adsorbed sulfur suppresses this penetration by enhancing etching. Furthermore, relatively recent work reported high Si etch yields using  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  pulsed plasmas that result in unusually large neutral Cl to ion bombardment flux ratios. These",

With the goal of better understanding plasma ALE, we have compared molecular dynamics simulation predictions of  $\\mathrm{Si - Cl}_2 - \\mathrm{Ar}$  ALE to experimental measurements of the Si etch per cycle (EPC) and etch products leaving the surface. In general, the simulations reproduce the major features of the measurements. EPC predictions as a function of ion energy are in reasonable agreement with measurements, especially at lower ion energies. Measured etch product distributions as a function of time in the cycle and ion energy are also in good agreement with predictions, especially early in the ion bombardment step. This set of agreements supports the basic picture that emerges from MD simulations of plasma- assisted ALE for this system, as summarized in the illustration in Fig. 5.",

There are multiple possible explanations for these disagreements. One possibility is Cl desorption from chamber walls followed by substrate incorporation during the ion bombardment step, an effect not included in the simulations. It is certainly possible that Cl subsurface diffusion is taking place in the experiments, leading to a more chlorinated layer than the simulations predict.",
