The chart illustrates a sequence of steps involving different materials and environments, starting with nitrogen (Nâ‚‚) in vacuum conditions, followed by hydrogen fluoride (HF), then nitrogen again, and finally trimethylamine (TMA). Each step is represented by a bar indicating the material and environment.
