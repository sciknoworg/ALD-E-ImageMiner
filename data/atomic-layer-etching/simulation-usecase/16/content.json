Hence, manufacturing industries are unable to meet this increase in demand. This growing dependency is forcing technology giants to experience sales losses (Voas et al., 2021) due to the decreasing production rate of their products. Prior to the Covid- 19 pandemic, semiconductor manufacturing facilities had already been struggling to maintain a steady supply of these devices due to time- consuming processes. The difficulty is involved in time- intensive fabrication and stricter quality specifications on their dimensions as the semiconductor devices, specifically transistors, continue to decrease in size as predicted by Moore's Law (Moore, 1998). In particular, one of the most essential components of the semiconductor fabrication process involves the modification of semiconductor surfaces by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and atomic layer etching (ALE) to produce highly conformal thin films that serve to insulate the semiconductor and have precise dimensions below 1 nm. ALE and ALD processes are able to de liver more precise control of monolayer thicknesses in the atomic scale (Ritala et al., 1999); however, these aforementioned processes are time- consuming and lack controllability. Thus, it is imperative to optimize the efficiency of the semiconductor fabrication process while maintaining process control and product conformance.",

However, with the miniaturization in the size of transistors, industries have encountered challenges associated with fabricating the fin width to 5 nm or lower, resulting in mobility loss and short- channel effects for FinFETs (Razavieh et al., 2019). To overcome this performance degradation, the development of gate- all- around (GAA) transistors has recently been investigated (Lee et al., 2020) and has been found to provide greater power efficiency, electrostatic properties, and resistance to short- channel effects (Guerfi and Larrieu, 2016). The aforementioned properties are attributed to the design of the GAA transistor such that vertically stacked channels called nanowires are enclosed on all sides of the transistor gate. A diagram comparing conventional FinFET and GAA transistors is presented in Fig. 1, which demonstrates the versatility of the GAA design that permits nanowire thicknesses of 5 nm or lower. The design of the GAA transistor is structured on precise measurements to achieve optimal design properties and maintain quality conformance; thus, the",

The metal oxide films have better uniformity, require lower process temperatures, and are inexpensive to fabricate (Ding and Wu, 2020; Ye et al., 2017), making these materials superior to silicon- based wafers. The desirability of metal oxide thin films is attributed to the lack of delocalization of electron movement between metal atoms, which increases the reactive tendency to surface layer modification (Sang and Chang, 2020). Among the many oxide films discussed by Fortunato et al. (2012), Faraz et al. (2015), Sheng et al., 2018, aluminum oxide  $(\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3)$  exemplifies the aforementioned properties of oxide films due to the reaction system described in Section 2.1. Aluminum, which possesses a low electronegativity and hence lesser desirability to attract electrons, can form stronger ionic bonds with a highly electronegative atom such as fluorine (Lee et al., 2016) during the ALD and ALE adsorption half- cycle reactions. As a result, adopting these opposing atoms requires less energy input to produce substantial reaction progress, facilitating the ALD and ALE processes to semiconductor fabrication from an economics perspective. Therefore, this research aims to study and characterize  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  as a thin film substrate for nanowires.",

        "text": "Thermal atomic layer deposition (ALE) is a premature process that is gradually being integrated into the semiconductor production industry and is known to be effective at depositing layers of material on the surfaces of semiconductor substrates. Thermal ALD uses gaseous reactants called precursors that are introduced in sequential pulses. The precursors make modifications to the surface of the substrate and introduce a depositing film to generate the thin film layer (Kanarik et al., 2015). Meanwhile, thermal atomic layer etching (ALE), a bifurcation of ALD, is a process that etches the substrate material by integrating gaseous reactant pulses. The reactant pulses convert the surface of the substrate into an active reaction layer and etch the modified surface layer (Kanarik et al., 2015). For the thermal ALD and ALE processes, the precursor pulses are separated by purging steps with a purge gas to flush the residual products from the reaction chamber. The applicability of ALD and ALE to semiconductor fabrication is based on the notion that these processes exhibit self- limiting behavior. This characteristic behavior prevents precursor adsorption beyond the substrate surface where the surface layer exemplifies a transport- limited barrier. In other words, the processes are restricted to a single atomic layer (monolayer) of the substrate material that can be deposited or etched for each cycle (Kanarik et al., 2018); thus providing substantial controllability over the thickness of the substrate in the Angstrom scale.",

However, for rapid atomic layer etching, researchers observed a degradation in the film roughness (Zywotko et al., 2018); thus spatial atomic layer processes are considered in this work as they are more reliable in maintaining thin film conformance (Levy et al., 2009). In spatial atomic layer deposition processes, the precursors are continuously dosed in physically separated reaction zones between the purging regions (Muñoz- Rojas et al., 2019) in order to permit precursor reactions in sequential steps. For the purposes of this paper, spatial atomic layer deposition (SALD) and spatial atomic layer etching (SALE) are referred to as spatial thermal ALD and spatial thermal ALE, respectively. The substrate is transferred through each region at a constant velocity and maintains a presence in the precursor regions that optimize the amount of material that is deposited onto the surface of the substrate. A schematic interpretation of the differences between conventional and spatial ALD/ALE processes are presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) resembles a conventional type ALD/ALE reactor where the substrate is stationary and consists of a single inlet and outlet. In a typical reactor for ALD/ALE, precursors are introduced separately into the reactor chamber, which is purged after each precursor injection. Fig. 2(b) shows the patented sheet- to- sheet (S2S) SALD/SALE reactor where the substrate moves between adjacent zones that are injected with inert gases or precursor species. There have been developments in SALD and SALE reactor design. The original design of the spatial ALD was developed by Suntola and Antson (1977), which was classified as a roll- to- roll type. Afterwards, rotating (Sharma et al., 2015; Aghaee et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017) and sheet- to- sheet models (Freeman et al., 2010) have been developed.",

To conduct experiments in a laboratory setting is costly, time- consuming, and difficult to study under controlled environments due to the spontaneous nature of the reactions, which occur semi- instantaneously. Thus, a computational simulation approach can be conducted to reflect laboratory- setting experiments to collect a diverse data set that can improve the characterization of these ALD and ALE processes in a cost- effective and timely manner. For instance, Pan et al., 2014 and Shaeri et al., 2015 have accomplished computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of ALD processes. To improve upon the CFD modeling, adopting a combined microscopic simulation using density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic theory with a macroscopic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, a \"Multiscale\" model of a laboratory- setting experiment can be conducted. Previous research has already been conducted on multiscale CFD simulation for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and ALD processes. For example, Crose et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2020) have performed a 3D multiscale CFD simulation for plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and plasma- enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), respectively, but their research is limited in the integration of the microscopic surface domain and the macroscopic gas- phase domain. Prior multiscale simulation was conducted in a two- step process such that CFD simulation of the macroscopic gas phase was run to the final flow time to extract the steady- state process parameters, which were later imported into the microscopic model to calculate the deposition rates. This method unreliably connects the microscopic and macroscopic domains but was previously adopted due to the complexity of the numerical simulation for a complete multiscale simulation, resulting in increased computation time. Also, prior research from Yun et al. (2022b) on the thermal ALE of aluminum oxide thin films adopted a method to include constant species consumption and generation terms in the CFD model to produce a stronger connection between the macroscopic and microscopic domains. However, this prior research was limited in computational efficiency due to the number of nodes specified in the surface substrate mesh, which prevented the development of a fully autonomous multiscale CFD model that updates the source generation and consumption terms through each multiscale loop.

The role of the gap distance serves to generate a finite boundary layer to prevent the intermixing of the precursor species, while the remaining parameters are crucial to the kinetics of the half- cycle reactions and to the self- limiting behavior of the half- cycle reactions. The aforementioned properties will be used to determine their impact on the quality of the substrate, which is determined by the amount of etching per cycle (EPC) and the surface uniformity of the substrate after the etching process.

First of all, the steady- state simulation mode in Fluent is used to run the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to analyze the effects of the gap distance, the  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  flow rate, precursor (HF and TMA) flow rates by using reactor configurations R1 through R4 without a substrate in Table 2. The effects of those parameters on precursor separation are discussed in the following sections. Then, on the basis of the results of the aforementioned simulation, the optimal reactor parameters are selected and used to investigate the effects of the substrate velocity and vacuum pressure on the film quality, which are simulated using the transient simulation mode in Fluent. In this paper, the term, \"cycle,\" is used even if the spatial atomic layer etching reactor is not operating in a cyclical operation. Thus, \"a cycle\" by definition occurs when a substrate passes through the 9 ports of the injection assembly. There are several assumptions that underlie the simulations: (1) there are manifolds in the upstream facility so the precursors and  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  are well- mixed and injected through the injection ports, (2) the temperature of the substrate surface is maintained by a PID (proportional- integral- derivative) controller at  $573~\\mathrm{K}$ , (3) the velocity of the substrate is constant in each simulation, (4) a vacuum pump, which is not constructed in the reactor configuration, is implemented to exhaust gases through the vacuum ports, and (5) a physical conveyor belt that moves the substrate is ignored, since the research focuses on the fluid regime between a substrate surface and the bottom of an injection assembly.",

Unsuccessful precursor separation would result in undesirable etching and spontaneous etching (Pan et al., 2016); therefore, an effective gas barrier design is needed. In this research, reactor configurations R1 through R4 with  $10.00~mm$ ,  $1.00~mm$ ,  $0.50~mm$ , and  $0.25~mm$  gap distances (shown in Table 5) are used to investigate the effect of the gap distance on precursor separation.

(2015) and the CFD results by De la Huerta et al., 2018, Pan (2021). The reported etching rate of  $0.46\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$  is obtained at velocities less than  $40~mm / s$  The  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  etching rate linearly reduces with increasing velocity for substrate velocities greater than  $40~mm / s$  This behavior can be used to determine the optimal velocity for etching  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  films. Film uniformity is highly required to produce conformal thin films in the semiconductor industry. Thus, a multiscale CFD simulation is performed on each node of the mesh of the surface to explore the film uniformity; therefore, 18 kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations are performed. As seen in Fig. 11(b), the uniform etch rate on the surface is observed with velocities of 80, 120, and  $160~mm / s$  The film conformance is quantitatively indicated by the highly low standard deviations of etched thickness for each cycle on 18 nodes of the surface mesh, which are 0.010, 0.007, and 0.002 A/cycle for 80, 120, and  $160~mm / s$  substrate velocities, respectively. In particular, the substrate has the desired uniformity at  $80~mm / s$  while a substrate velocity of  $160~mm / s$  has marginal degradation of the uniformity of the film. The results imply that the short exposure time attributed to higher velocities has some surface roughness that is able to disrupt conformal etching reactions on the surface.",

The quality of the substrate film is based on an etch rate and substrate film uniformity obtained from the reactor configuration. An multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to fabricate the relationship between the fundamental characteristics of the SALE reactor design. The multiscale CFD model was constructed by integrating a kMC- based microscopic model with a CFD- based macroscopic model. The multiscale CFD simulation revealed that the lower gap distances ensure effective separation of the precursors.
