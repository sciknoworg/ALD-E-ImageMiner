Hence, manufacturing industries are unable to meet this increase in demand. This growing dependency is forcing technology giants to experience sales losses (Voas et al., 2021) due to the decreasing production rate of their products. Prior to the Covid- 19 pandemic, semiconductor manufacturing facilities had already been struggling to maintain a steady supply of these devices due to time- consuming processes. The difficulty is involved in time- intensive fabrication and stricter quality specifications on their dimensions as the semiconductor devices, specifically transistors, continue to decrease in size as predicted by Moore's Law (Moore, 1998). In particular, one of the most essential components of the semiconductor fabrication process involves the modification of semiconductor surfaces by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and atomic layer etching (ALE) to produce highly conformal thin films that serve to insulate the semiconductor and have precise dimensions below 1 nm. ALE and ALD processes are able to de "

                                    "content": "Among the diverse types of semiconductors, fin field- effect transistors (FinFETs) have been recognized for facilitating the process to engrave three- dimensional (3D) patterns on circuit boards leading to an increase in computing speed and reduction of current losses (Jurczak et al., 2009). However, with the miniaturization in the size of transistors, industries have encountered challenges associated with fabricating the fin width to 5 nm or lower, resulting in mobility loss and short- channel effects for FinFETs (Razavieh et al., 2019). To overcome this performance degradation, the development of gate- all- around (GAA) transistors has recently been investigated (Lee et al., 2020) and has been found to provide greater power efficiency, electrostatic properties, and resistance to short- channel effects (Guerfi and Larrieu, 2016). The aforementioned properties are attributed to the design of the GAA transistor such that vertically stacked channels called nanowires are enclosed on all sides of the transistor gate. A diagram comparing conventional FinFET and GAA transistors is presented in Fig. 1, which demonstrates the versatility of the GAA design that permits nanowire thicknesses of 5 nm or lower. The design of the GAA transistor is structured on precise measurements to achieve optimal design properties and maintain quality conformance; thus, the"

The metal oxide films have better uniformity, require lower process temperatures, and are inexpensive to fabricate (Ding and Wu, 2020; Ye et al., 2017), making these materials superior to silicon- based wafers. The desirability of metal oxide thin films is attributed to the lack of delocalization of electron movement between metal atoms, which increases the reactive tendency to surface layer modification (Sang and Chang, 2020). Among the many oxide films discussed by Fortunato et al. (2012), Faraz et al. (2015), Sheng et al., 2018, aluminum oxide "

Thermal ALD uses gaseous reactants called precursors that are introduced in sequential pulses. The precursors make modifications to the surface of the substrate and introduce a depositing film to generate the thin film layer (Kanarik et al., 2015). Meanwhile, thermal atomic layer etching (ALE), a bifurcation of ALD, is a process that etches the substrate material by integrating gaseous reactant pulses. The reactant pulses convert the surface of the substrate into an active reaction layer and etch the modified surface layer (Kanarik et al., 2015). For the thermal ALD and ALE processes, the precursor pulses are separated by purging steps with a purge gas to flush the residual products from the reaction chamber. The applicability of ALD and ALE to semiconductor fabrication is based on the notion that these processes exhibit self- limiting behavior. This characteristic behavior prevents precursor adsorption beyond the substrate surface where the surface layer exemplifies a transport- limited barrier. In other words, the processes are restricted to a single atomic layer (monolayer) of the substrate material that can be deposited or etched for each cycle (Kanarik et al., 2018); thus providing substantial controllability over the thickness of the substrate in the Angstrom scale."

However, for rapid atomic layer etching, researchers observed a degradation in the film roughness (Zywotko et al., 2018); thus spatial atomic layer processes are considered in this work as they are more reliable in maintaining thin film conformance (Levy et al., 2009). In spatial atomic layer deposition processes, the precursors are continuously dosed in physically separated reaction zones between the purging regions (Muñoz- Rojas et al., 2019) in order to permit precursor reactions in sequential steps. For the purposes of this paper, spatial atomic layer deposition (SALD) and spatial atomic layer etching (SALE) are referred to as spatial thermal ALD and spatial thermal ALE, respectively. The substrate is transferred through each region at a constant velocity and maintains a presence in the precursor regions that optimize the amount of material that is deposited onto the surface of the substrate. A schematic interpretation of the differences between conventional and spatial ALD/ALE processes are presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) resembles a conventional type ALD/ALE reactor where the substrate is stationary and consists of a single inlet and outlet. In a typical reactor for ALD/ALE, precursors are introduced separately into the reactor chamber, which is purged after each precursor injection. Fig. 2(b) shows the patented sheet- to- sheet (S2S) SALD/SALE reactor where the substrate moves between adjacent zones that are injected with inert gases or precursor species. There have been developments in SALD and SALE reactor design. The original design of the spatial ALD was developed by Suntola and Antson (1977), which was classified as a roll- to- roll type. Afterwards, rotating (Sharma et al., 2015; Aghaee et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017) and sheet- to- sheet models (Freeman et al., 2010) have been developed."

For instance, Pan et al., 2014 and Shaeri et al., 2015 have accomplished computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of ALD processes. To improve upon the CFD modeling, adopting a combined microscopic simulation using density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic theory with a macroscopic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, a \"Multiscale\" model of a laboratory- setting experiment can be conducted. Previous research has already been conducted on multiscale CFD simulation for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and ALD processes. For example, Crose et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2020) have performed a 3D multiscale CFD simulation for plasma- enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and plasma- enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), respectively, but their research is limited in the integration of the microscopic surface domain and the macroscopic gas- phase domain. Prior multiscale simulation was conducted in a two- step process such that CFD simulation of the macroscopic gas phase was run to the final flow time to extract the steady- state process parameters, which were later imported into the microscopic model to calculate the deposition rates. This method unreliably connects the microscopic and macroscopic domains but was previously adopted due to the complexity of the numerical simulation for a complete multiscale simulation, resulting in increased computation time. Also, prior research from Yun et al. (2022b) on the thermal ALE of aluminum oxide thin films adopted a method to include constant species consumption and generation terms in the CFD model to produce a stronger connection between the macroscopic and microscopic domains. However, this prior research was limited in computational efficiency due to the number of nodes specified in the surface substrate mesh, which prevented the development of a fully autonomous multiscale CFD model that updates the source generation and consumption terms through each multiscale loop. Thus, this work makes enhancements to the previously developed mul"

Several studies (Pan et al., 2016; Cong et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021) have been conducted on the gap distance between the top surface of the substrate to the bottom surface of the injection dividers, the purge gas flow rate, the precursor flow rates, the substrate velocity, and the vacuum pump pressure. The role of the gap distance serves to generate a finite boundary layer to prevent the intermixing of the precursor species, while the remaining parameters are crucial to the kinetics of the half- cycle reactions and to the self- limiting behavior of the half- cycle reactions. The aforementioned properties will be used to determine their impact on the quality of the substrate, which is determined by the amount of etching per cycle (EPC) and the surface uniformity of the substrate after the etching process. Thus, this research aims to advance from a previously developed microscopic model for the ALE of aluminum oxide "

The aforementioned projects have investigated the design of SALD reactors by examining the effects of the substrate velocity (De la Huerta et al., 2018; Pan, 2021), the gap distance (De la Huerta et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2016), the pitch distance between adjacent injectors (Cong et al., 2020), the precursor flow rate (Deng et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2016; Cong et al., 2020), and the purge gas flow rate (Deng et al., 2016). These investigations provide invaluable information for SALD; however, they do not discuss the surface kinetics from the microscopic perspective. In addition, the relationship of the dynamic effects of the moving substrate on the film uniformity has not been investigated as conformity is an essential parameter to discuss the quality of the finished product. Thus, a complete survey of a spatial reactor configuration is required to include all technical information while accounting for the multiscale point of view to provide theoretical guidance toward further operation and control of a SALD/SALE reactor and process. Therefore, this research aims to build a multiscale CFD model by integrating a microscopic model for the surface kinetics and a macroscopic model for the transport phenomena effects to offer a comprehensive understanding and to investigate key parameters to optimize the reactor configuration and operation."

The practical usage of the kMC method serves to bridge the microscopic and macroscopic regimes. Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations for atomic layer processes have been widely used (Lou and Christofides, 2003; Fu et al., 2008; Shirazi and Elliott, 2014; Ding et al., 2019, 2020; Yun et al., 2022a) for surface reaction kinetics. In this research, the developed kMC- based microscopic model by Yun et al. (2022a), validated with the experimental work from Lee et al. (2016), is adopted to characterize the surface reactions on "

First, WorkBench 2021R2, one of the Ansys packages, is used to construct the mesh with triangular elements for five reactors (denoted as R1 through R5) whose mesh quality is quantified in Table 2. The mesh quality plays a significant role in the convergence, numerical solution accuracy, and stability of the CFD computation. As shown in Table 2, the mesh quality of all reactor designs built in this research is considered acceptable by the criteria defined by ANSYS (2021). A more detailed discussion of the mesh quality parameters is given in Yun et al. (2022b)."

The CFD simulations with 4 different precursor flow rates (Cases 1, 8, 9, and 10 shown in Table 3) are performed to study the effect of precursor flow rates on precursor separation. When the flow rates of the precursors increase, the mole fractions of the precursors increase in the half- reaction zones, which accelerate the HF adsorption and TMA ligand exchange reactions on the surfaces as presented in Fig. 6. Also, Fig. 8 illustrates that the precursor intermixing in the half- reaction zones is marginally affected by changes in the precursor flow rate. However, in the "

The vacuum pressure is defined as an outflow pressure boundary condition in Ansys Fluent, which is varied to determine its effects on the EPC of the substrate. The relationship between EPC and vacuum pressure for variable substrate velocities is further examined in Fig. 12, which indicates that high vacuum pressure magnitudes lead to a decrease in EPC and the vacuum pressure effects on EPC for lower substrate velocities are insignificant. Several factors contribute to the aforementioned results, including increased vacuum pressure, which decreases the partial pressure of precursors within the reaction injection zones and increasing substrate velocity results in decreased substrate exposure time to the precursors and ultimately decreased coverage and etching fractions on the substrate."

Implementing a higher substrate velocity to the reactor configuration revealed a lower etching rate due to the reduced exposure time of the substrate. In addition, the larger vacuum pump resulted in a lower etching rate due to its strong precursor suction. As a result, the developed SALE reactor design and operating conditions were able to produce conformal ultrathin films."
