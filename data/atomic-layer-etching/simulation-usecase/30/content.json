        "text": "ABSTRACT: Thermal atomic layer etching (ALEt) of amorphous  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  was performed by alternate exposures of niobium pentafluoride  $(\\mathrm{NbF}_5)$  and carbon tetrachloride  $(\\mathrm{CCl}_4)$ . The ALEt of  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  is observed at temperatures from 380 to  $460^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The etched thickness and the etch rate were determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and verified by X- ray reflectivity. The maximum etch rate of about  $1.4\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle and a linear increase of the removed film thickness with the number of etch cycles were obtained at a temperature of  $460^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . With the help of density functional theory calculations, an etch mechanism is proposed where  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  converts part of the  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surface into an  $\\mathrm{AlF}_3$  or aluminum oxyfluoride layer, which upon reacting with  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  is converted into volatile halide- containing byproducts, thus etching away the converted portion of the material. Consistent with this, a significant surface fluorine content of about 55 at.  $\\%$  was revealed when the elemental depth profile analysis of a thick  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  - treated  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  layer was performed by X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface morphology of the reference, pre- , and postetch  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  surfaces was analyzed using atomic force microscopy and bright- field transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, it is found that this process chemistry is able to etch  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  selectively over silicon dioxide  $(\\mathrm{SiO}_2)$  and silicon nitride  $(\\mathrm{Si}_3\\mathrm{N}_4)$ .",

The aim of the DFT simulations is to map out the general form of the ALEt mechanism. Many reactions and byproducts can be possible, and we seek here to distinguish which surface transformations are thermodynamically favorable as a function of process conditions. This can reveal the nature of the saturating surface after each precursor exposure during the ALEt cycle and hence account for the etch rate. However, ALEt is actually a non- equilibrium process, driven by kinetics and the irreversible removal of byproducts from the surface into the gas flow. Computing the detailed sequence of surface adsorbates, intermediates, reaction pathways, and associated kinetics with DFT would be a possible future step but is beyond the current scope. It is worth remembering, therefore, that a reaction computed here to be thermodynamically feasible (with  $\\Delta G< 0$  at a given  $T$  may in fact face a high kinetic barrier and so not be observed on the experimental time scale.

At  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , excess fluorination was performed for 150 and 600 cycles of  $4.5\\mathrm{~s~}$ $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  pulse times, while 150 and 800 cycles of  $3\\mathrm{~s~}$ $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  pulse times were used at  $460^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . After performing the excess fluorination step, the thickness of the formed  $\\mathrm{AlF}_x[\\mathrm{O}]$  layer was measured by ex situ SE. About 11 and  $14\\mathrm{~nm}$  thick fluorinated layers were obtained after 450 and  $2400\\mathrm{~s~}$  of total  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  exposure time, respectively, at  $460^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The formation of thick  $(>10\\mathrm{~nm})$ $\\mathrm{AlF}_x[\\mathrm{O}]$  layers must be due to the prolonged fluorination step and the fluoride ions diffusing deeper into the aluminum oxide layer. The diffusion of fluoride is evidently dependent on the temperature and thus may hint at the existence of no ALE window. According to Morelock et al., aluminum trifluoride adopts a cubic form above  $440^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , which upon cooling changes to a rhombohedral phase. The X- ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of about  $11\\mathrm{~nm}$ $\\mathrm{AlF}_x[\\mathrm{O}]$  layer revealed the rhombohedral phase (see the Supporting Information S4) and is thus consistent with the literature. On the contrary, at  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , the thickness of the fluorinated layer stayed around  $3\\mathrm{~nm}$  even after prolonged total  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  exposure of  $2700\\mathrm{~s~}$ .
