The chart illustrates the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) over temperature for various chemical reactions involving aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), chlorine compounds, and fluorine slabs. The reactions are labeled with codes R8 through R14, each representing different conditions such as varying percentages of fluorine and chlorine slabs.
