| a) | A 3D representation of a molecular structure with atoms connected by bonds, showing a repeating pattern of hexagonal rings. |
| b) | Another 3D molecular structure, similar to a), but with a different arrangement of atoms and bonds, also forming a repeating hexagonal pattern. |
| c) | A third 3D molecular structure, distinct from a) and b), featuring a unique configuration of atoms and bonds, again forming a repeating pattern. |
| d) | A final 3D molecular structure, differing from the others, with a specific arrangement of atoms and bonds, forming a distinct repeating pattern. |
