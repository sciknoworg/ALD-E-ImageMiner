While atomic layer deposition (ALD) has already been established as a key enabler in cutting- edge semiconductor device manufacturing, it still has to be augmented with robust atomically controlled selective etching to fabricate next- generation devices. Historically, etching of materials has been performed using plasma in the process known as \"dry etching\". The plasma, an energized gas containing ions and radicals, continuously etches the material as long as it is switched on or until stops or masks are reached, making it a relatively uncontrolled process. Because the critical dimensions of semiconductor devices have shrunk tremendously, etch accuracy down to a single atomic layer has become necessary."

To keep this step as self- limiting as possible, accurate control of the ion energies and process conditions is required. An alternative approach to the use of high- energy ions is termed \"thermal\" ALE, as it uses thermally activated reactions to remove the modified layer. Because only non- ionized gas phase precursors are used, this method allows for isotropic etching of materials even at high aspect ratios. Typically, the thermal energy used in such etch processes is much lower than the ion bombardment energy, and therefore, this method could be used when materials are sensitive to the high- energy techniques. For particular applications, a combination of directional plasma ALE and thermal ALE can also be considered."

This surface modification has to be self- limiting in nature; i.e., the intermediates produced in the reaction must not be volatile species that would continuously desorb and lead to uncontrolled etching of the substrate. Any additional precursor molecules that do not participate in the surface modification and other byproducts are purged away efficiently. In the second pulse, precursor 2 (for example, a ligand exchanging agent) is introduced into the ALE chamber to interact with the modified layer of the substrate and produce stable and volatile byproducts. It is important once again that this step is also self- limiting in nature and that the precursor 2 molecules do not interact with the \"unmodified\" substrate atoms. The volatile byproducts and unreacted precursor molecules are then safely removed in the second purge event, which leaves a clean substrate layer. This completes one ALE cycle. In some cases, the second precursor pulse may leave nonvolatile species at the surface that may block surface sites for the first precursor in the next cycle."

Following that, the mechanism of molecular HF adsorption on a bare alumina surface is reported. This includes the estimation of minimum energy pathways for the migration of a H atom on the surface along with corresponding energetic barriers. In the next part, multiple HF adsorption and the resulting minimum energy geometries are investigated to understand the saturation of the alumina surface with HF. Toward the end of this section, a possible hydrogen transport mechanism and pathways leading to the formation and desorption of water molecules are reported."
