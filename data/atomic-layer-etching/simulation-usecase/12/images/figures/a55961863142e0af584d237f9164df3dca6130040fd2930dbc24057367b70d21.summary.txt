The diagram illustrates various structures (M<sup>0</sup>, M<sup>1</sup><sub>A</sub>, M<sup>1</sup><sub>B</sub>, M<sup>1</sup><sub>C</sub>, M<sup>1</sup><sub>D</sub>) along with their corresponding binding energies in electron volts (eV). The binding energy decreases as the structures become more complex.
