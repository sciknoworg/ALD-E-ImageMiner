In this Perspective, we describe ALE in comparison to long- standing conventional etching techniques, relating it to the underlying principles behind the ancient art of etching. Once considered too slow, we show how leveraging plasma has made ALE a thousand times faster than earlier approaches. While Si is the case study ALE material, prospects are better for strongly bound materials such as C, Ta, W, and Ru. Among the ALE advantages discussed, we introduce an ALE benefit with potentially broad application—the ALE smoothing effect—in which the surface flattens. Finally, regarding its well- established counterpart of atomic layer deposition (ALD), we discuss the combination of ALE and ALD in tackling real world challenges at sub- 10 nm technology nodes.",

Microscopically, etching means that atoms are removed from a substrate by breaking bonds that attach them to their neighbors, which means overcoming an energetic barrier called the surface binding energy, or  $E_0$ . The  $E_0$  is an average energy, given that each individual atom has a barrier that depends on its specific position and orientation on the surface. For example, atoms residing at imperfections—kinks, corners, or protrusions—may require a different amount of energy to be removed than atoms on a flat plane. For most materials,  $E_0$  values range from 2 to  $12 \\mathrm{eV}$ ; that of silicon (Si) is  $4.7 \\mathrm{eV}$ . In principle, many different methods can be used to modify or overcome  $E_0$ , including those shown in Figure 1, as follows",

In the semiconductor industry, plasma is more commonly used as it dissociates gases into highly reactive radicals  $(\\epsilon ,g,\\mathrm{F}^{*})$  .Modification of the surface can enhance etching through chemisorption as the radicals transform the surface into volatile species:  $\\mathrm{Si(s) + 4F^*(plasma)\\rightarrow SiF_4(g)}$  .In this way, the new chemical bond alters the barrier to removal of a surface atom by providing a different pathway, now through desorption of the new species (Figure 1a).

Traveling at speeds of greater than  $10 \\mathrm{~km / s}$ , the ion upon impact produces a \"hot spot\" of  $\\sim 3000 \\mathrm{~K}$ .

That much bombarding energy is needed because, statistically, a molecule being removed must rebound up and away from the surface, and this is not usually caused by the initial ion strike. Instead, the impact energy dissipates as roughly 100 atoms bounce off of each other during the picosecond time scale collision cascade. With chemically reduced  $E_{\\mathrm{des}}$ , the mechanism is referred to as reactive sputtering, and the threshold ion energy is lowered to  $16 \\mathrm{eV}$  for chlorinated Si.

As such, it is expected to be particularly evident in high  $E_0$  materials, such as those cited above. We postulate several reasons for the effect, focusing on directional ALE. In Step A, a small radius of curvature can have adsorption sites with higher reactivity to Cl, and this may preferentially etch sharp corners faster (for example, if Si bonds to  $2 - 3 \\mathrm{Cl}$  atoms at protrusions instead of  $1 \\mathrm{Cl}$  on flat surfaces), Furthermore, in Step B, computational studies have shown that  $50 \\mathrm{eV}$  inert ions, in the absence of reactants, can flatten surfaces through amorphization/recrystallization (Figure 5b) as ion energy promotes diffusion of surface atoms. In contrast, diffusion of the surface atoms is hindered by strong Cl bonds attached to the Si in RIE. In support, Park et al. report that roughness is induced, rather than improved, if the ALE process only partially removes chlorine, more akin to a RIE process.

Directionality in small features requires an extremely high level of directionality, and even with ALE, there may still be undesirable secondary reactions (in part due to longer saturation times needed in tight features).
