The contour plots depict the thermodynamic behavior of different systems (CVE1, SL, CVE1-SL) under varying pressures of reactants and products. The color gradient indicates the change in Î”G (eV), with 'Favorable', 'Unfavorable', and 'Etching' labels indicating favorable conditions, unfavorable conditions, and etching respectively.
