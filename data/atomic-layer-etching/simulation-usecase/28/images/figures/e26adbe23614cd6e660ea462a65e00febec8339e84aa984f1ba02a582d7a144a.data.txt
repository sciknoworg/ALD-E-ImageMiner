| a)     | A 3D molecular structure with red spheres representing oxygen atoms and pink spheres representing boron atoms. The structure is enclosed within a black cube. |
| b)     | A 3D molecular structure similar to section a), but with additional green spheres representing fluorine atoms. The letters 'B', 'O', and 'F' are placed above the structure, indicating the elements present. |
| c)     | A 3D molecular structure identical to sections a) and b), but with a different arrangement of atoms, suggesting a variation in the molecular configuration. |
