The contour plots depict the thermodynamic favorability of reactions at different temperatures (T) and reactant pressures (Preactants). The left plot shows a 'Favorable' reaction across all conditions, while the middle plot indicates 'Unfavorable' reactions at higher pressures and temperatures. The right plot shows the difference between CVE1 and SL, highlighting regions where etching occurs.
