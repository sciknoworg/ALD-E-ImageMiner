The dissociative adsorption of  $\\mathrm{F_2}$  occurs at very low temperatures (100 K) and the surface becomes populated by  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  (the most stable), and  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  groups. Etching processes begin with the desorption of the  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  group and only at very high temperatures the desorption of  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  was observed. Sulfur vacancies left by the removal of S atoms are rapidly filled by F atoms due to the formation of strong  $\\mathrm{Mo}$  F bonds. The formation of a sulfur vacancy induces the subsequent formation of S- vacancies on adjacent surface sites, and this finally promotes the desorption of  $\\mathrm{MoF_5}$  or  $\\mathrm{MoF_6}$  species, thus leaving a surface pit defect. For a  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  bilayer with the top layer fluorinated on both sides, the etching of the top layer was observed as a consequence of the release of  $\\mathrm{SF_x}$  species within the interlayer region.",

The direct bandgap of the monolayer confers  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  a strong luminescence and high quantum yield with promising applications in different optoelectronic devices.[2,3] Therefore, controlling the number of layers of 2D materials is indispensable for nanodevice applications because of their layer- dependent optical features. Controlling the thickness of  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  films during growth is a difficult task due to nonuniform domains having different number of layers.[4,5] A different strategy is to remove  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  layers after synthesis using post- treatment procedures. Etching is one of the key steps in materials processing in the semiconducting industry and several etching techniques have been proposed to control the layer number and patterning of 2D materials.[4- 12] The main etching techniques include plasma etching,[5,7,8,11,13] laser thinning,[4,14], and thermal annealing thinning.[6,15] Thinning of  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  leads to enhanced photoluminescence which is beneficial for photodetector fabrication.

In the second part, we investigate the dynamics of the fluorinated surfaces at different temperatures, which clearly reveal the mechanisms of surface reactions and desorption processes. The  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  surface is very reactive toward  $\\mathrm{F_2}$  molecules and high surface coverages are readily obtained. The  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  surface group is the most stable, having stronger S- F bonds than the SF and  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  groups. The etching process mainly begins with the desorption of  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  species which, upon abstraction of an F atom from adjacent surface sites, leads to the desorption of  $\\mathrm{SF_4}$  molecules into the gas phase.

The adsorption process is exothermic with  $\\Delta \\mathrm{E} = - 0.47\\mathrm{eV}$ , showing that there is a strong interaction between  $\\mathrm{F_2}$  and the pristine  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  monolayer. Small inorganic molecules have much lower adsorption energies, typically ranging from  $- 0.10$  to  $- 0.25\\mathrm{eV}$ .[37- 40] The F- F bond distance increases from  $1.417\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in vacuum to  $1.581\\mathrm{\\AA}$  upon adsorption. The weakening of the F- F bond is a consequence of charge transfer process from the surface to the  $\\sigma^{*}_{2\\mathrm{p}}$  antibonding orbital. The electron density difference plot in Fig. 1a shows a region of charge accumulation around the F atoms which resembles the shape of  $\\sigma^{*}_{2\\mathrm{p}}$  orbital. Fig. 1b shows the electron difference plot around an F atom bound to a sulfur atom. Besides the region of charge accumulation around the F atom, regions of charge depletion are observed along the S- Mo bonds, which anticipate the weakening of these bonds. The formation of the S- F bond from a fluorine atom in vacuum has  $\\Delta \\mathrm{E} = - 2.18\\mathrm{eV}$  and the adsorption of the F atom on an S vacancy site has  $\\Delta \\mathrm{E} = - 4.61\\mathrm{eV}$ . In the latter case, the F atom adsorbs in the hollow site between three Mo atoms (see Fig. S1). The surface S- F bond  $(2.18\\mathrm{eV})$  is weaker than the average S- F bond strength in the  $\\mathrm{SF_4}$  molecule for which we calculated a value of  $4.06\\mathrm{eV}$ . The different strength between surface and gas- phase S- F bonds explains many features observed in the MD simulations. The strong interaction of F atoms on the pristine and S defective  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  surface and the weak F- F bond energy of the fluorine molecule, which is  $1.60\\mathrm{eV}$ [41], indicate that the dissociative adsorption of  $\\mathrm{F_2}$  will be an exothermic process, as we show next.",

        "text": "In order to obtain a deeper insight into the etching mechanism of multilayer  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  we performed simulations for a  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  bilayer where the top layer is fluorinated on both sides as shown in Fig. 9a. We started the simulations with the top layer having a pit originating from 3 S to vacancies sites and 1 Mo vacancy, which is the outcome of the simulation shown in Fig. 8 (see the top view in the panel at 25.000 ps). We assume that the interlayer F atoms are incorporated at grain boundaries or surface pits. The snapshot in Fig. 9a (1500 K) shows that most F atoms are bound to the top layer, and this is more clearly evidenced in the trajectories of F and Mo atoms shown in Fig. 9b (for the sake of clarity, the trajectories of S atoms are not shown). On average, the trajectories of F atoms are closer to the top layer of Mo atoms than to the bottom layer (the red profile shows the trajectory of an F atom that penetrated the layer of S atoms). Fig. 9b shows that most F atoms diffuse freely in the interlayer region at  $1500~\\mathrm{K}$ . Only the F atoms bound to the S atoms around the pit remain in this position, indicating a stronger SF bonding. Up to around 10 ps, the average interlayer spacing remains constant. Fig. S9 compares the interlayer separation in the absence of F atoms (around  $6.5\\mathrm{\\AA}$ ) as well as when there are 5 and 12F atoms in the interlayer region (around  $7.5\\mathrm{\\AA}$ ). However, in the latter case, the interlayer separation begins to increase after 10 ps of simulation time. This is explained by the snapshots shown in Fig. 9c. An SF group within the interlayer region around the pit reacts with a diffusing F atom (not shown) giving rise to an  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  group in the interlayer region (panel at 10.392 ps). As the simulation advances the  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  molecule abstracts F atoms to become  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  (panel at 10.602 ps) and  $\\mathrm{SF_4}$  (panel at 13.479 ps) and the interlayer separation keeps increasing as is clearly shown in the panel at 15.567 ps of Fig. 9c. The decreasing energy profile in Fig. 9d indicates that these etching processes are exothermic. The black arrows in Fig. 9d indicate the times at which  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  and  $\\mathrm{SF_4}$  desorbed from the top layer to the gas phase (not shown) whereas the red arrows indicate the desorption times within the interlayer region. In summary, this simulation shows the mechanisms involved in the etching of the top  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$",

The  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  surface has a high reactivity towards  $\\mathrm{F_2}$  molecules which dissociatively adsorb at temperatures as low as  $100~\\mathrm{K}$ , whereas at  $300~\\mathrm{K}$  surface coverages up to  $70\\%$  were achieved during the short times of AIMD simulations. This high reactivity is explained by the formation of strong S- F bonds after the breakage of the weak F- F bond of  $\\mathrm{F_2}$ . The surface chemistry of fluorinated  $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  is characterized by the presence of SF,  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$ , and  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  groups with different stabilities and dynamical behaviors. The most stable surface structures have a majority of  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  groups (Table 1).

On the contrary, the F atoms of  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  remain rather fixed on the xy plane even at high temperatures and the only pathway for vibrational energy relaxation is the desorption of the  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  group, in a slightly endothermic process  $(\\Delta \\mathrm{E} = 0.39\\mathrm{eV})$ . The high stability of  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  groups is also evidenced in the large  $\\Delta \\mathrm{E}$  value of  $2.08\\mathrm{eV}$  for  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  desorption (Equation (11)).",

        "text": "$\\mathrm{MoS_2}$  etching requires a critical surface coverage. At  $50\\%$  surface coverage, we did not observe desorption processes, only the diffusion of F atoms between adjacent S sites occurred at high temperatures. At surface coverages of  $100\\%$  and  $125\\%$ , the surface is mainly populated by  $\\mathrm{SF_2}$  groups, but desorption processes involved the  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  groups. The initial desorption of  $\\mathrm{SF_3}$  also promoted the abstraction of adjacent F atoms when available to yield a gas- phase  $\\mathrm{SF_4}$  molecule. As shown by Equation (13), this reaction is very exothermic with  $\\Delta \\mathrm{E} = - 1.11\\mathrm{eV}$ . The sulfur vacancies left by the desorption of  $\\mathrm{SF_x}$  species are rapidly filled by F atoms in adjacent SF groups. Equation (16) shows that this reaction is very exothermic  $(\\Delta \\mathrm{E} = - 2.48\\mathrm{eV})$  and the driving force for this process relies on the fact that the Mo- F bond energy  $(4.61\\mathrm{eV})$  is much stronger than the S- F bond energy  $(2.18\\mathrm{eV})$  as discussed in section 3.1. The formation of a sulfur vacancy induces the etching of adjacent sulfur atoms, and this finally promotes the desorption of  $\\mathrm{MoF_5}$  or  $\\mathrm{MoF_6}$  species, thus leaving a surface pit defect (Fig. 8b, panel at 25.000 ps).
