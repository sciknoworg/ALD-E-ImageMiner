The image displays three different 3D molecular structures labeled (a), (b), and (c). Each structure consists of atoms represented by spheres, where pink spheres represent aluminum (Al) and red spheres represent oxygen (O). The structures are viewed from different angles, highlighting the arrangement of atoms within each unit cell.
