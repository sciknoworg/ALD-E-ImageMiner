The image displays three different 3D molecular structures labeled (a), (b), and (c). Each structure consists of atoms represented by spheres, with aluminum (Al) atoms shown in pink and fluorine (F) atoms in light blue. The structures are viewed from various angles, highlighting the arrangement of atoms within each unit cell.
