<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) study of the mechanism of thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ). Using amorphous Al₂O₃ and aluminum fluoride (AlF 3 ) slab models generated by ab initio molecular dynamics and optimized by DFT, we simulated the sequential surface reactions. The fluorination reactions with hydrogen fluoride (HF), leading to the formation of multilayer AlF 3 and the release of H 2 O and CH 4 , were calculated to occur spontaneously at 250 • C with low activation energies ranging from 0.18 to 1.14 eV. The subsequent removal reactions with trimethylaluminum (TMA) were also spontaneous, with low activation energies of less than 1.08 eV, releasing the dimethylaluminum fluoride dimer. Our results indicate that the Al 2 O 3 ALE is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible at 250 • C, which agrees with experimental observations in the literature. In addition, the self-limiting nature of the removal step and the formation of multilayer AlF 3 were also explained.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Atomic layer processing is becoming essential for the fabrication of advanced three-dimensional devices. Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a well-established technique that uses sequential, self-limiting surface reactions to deposit thin films with excellent conformality and atomicscale thickness control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Complementary to ALD, atomic layer etching (ALE) uses sequential surface modification and removal steps, which can be partially or fully self-limiting, allowing material removal with atomic precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. ALE is broadly categorized into plasma ALE and thermal ALE. Plasma ALE is inherently anisotropic because it relies on ion bombardment to remove the modified layer. In contrast, thermal ALE is isotropic because it uses chemical reactions to form and remove the modified layer.</p><p>Thermal ALE was first demonstrated for aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) films using hydrogen fluoride (HF) for surface modification and tin(II) acetylacetonate (Sn(acac) 2 ) for removal reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Subsequent studies have reported several ALE processes for Al 2 O 3 using different combinations, including combinations of HF with trimethylaluminum (Al(CH 3 ) 3 , TMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, dimethylaluminum chloride (AlCl(CH 3 ) 2 , DMAC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, or boron chloride (BCl 3 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, as well as niobium(V) fluoride (NbF 5 ) with carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The surface reactions governing the thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 by HF and TMA have been investigated by in situ characterization. During HF exposure, the hydroxyl (-OH) and methyl (-CH 3 ) groups are replaced by fluorine atoms, which were detected by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This resulted in the formation of the AlF 3 layer and the release of H 2 O, which were detected by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, respectively.</p><p>However, in contrast to ALD, a comprehensive atomic-level theoretical understanding of the thermal ALE process remains limited. The fluorination of bare theta-alumina by HF at 0 K has been simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These calculations indicated that the fluorination reactions are exothermic but suggested that H 2 O formation is unfavorable due to high activation energies above 1.63 eV. Critically, the activation energy of the fluorination reaction itself was not calculated, and the reaction of HF with -OH or -CH 3 groups was not considered. More recently, a DFT study investigated the removal reaction of crystalline alpha-AlF 3 by TMA and showed it to be thermodynamically favorable <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Nevertheless, a calculated activation energy of 1.49 eV was reported, which is relatively high considering typical ALE process temperatures of 150-325 • C <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In our previous work, we investigated the gas-phase etching mechanism of amorphous hydrogenated silicon nitride by HF using DFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We explained the continuous etching at elevated temperatures, a phenomenon that could not be explained by the simulation of crystalline Si 3 N 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, thus highlighting the importance of the material structure.</p><p>In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 using DFT calculations, providing a comprehensive analysis covering both the fluorination by HF and the subsequent removal of the fluorinated layer by TMA. Our investigation is guided by the previous experimental results regarding the changes in surface species and the release of byproducts during thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 , as schematically illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. To simulate fluorination and removal reactions, we used amorphous Al 2 O 3 (a-Al 2 O 3 ) and amorphous AlF 3 (a-AlF 3 ) substrate models, respectively, due to the significant influence of crystallinity on etching reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Aluminum oxide and fluoride films are amorphous at ALE process temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>The amorphous models were generated by the melt-quench method using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), followed by geometry optimization with DFT. For the fluorination step, we constructed the a-Al 2 O 3 terminated with -OH and -CH 3 as well as fluorinated surfaces and simulated all possible pathways for successive fluorination by HF. For the removal step, we constructed an -F terminated a-AlF 3 surface model and simulated the sequential reactions involved in the removal of AlF 3 by TMA. For both fluorination and removal reactions, we evaluated and compared the reaction and activation energies at 0 K as well as the free energy changes at 250 • C for different pathways to identify the thermodynamically and kinetically favorable mechanisms. Finally, the DFT results are compared with experimental in situ characterization data reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> for validation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Surface reaction modeling</head><p>The main potential pathways for the multistep fluorination and removal reactions were modeled and simulated. Five representative states were defined for each surface reaction pathway. The unbound reactant state (UR) corresponds to a configuration in which the substrate and the incoming reactant molecule (HF or TMA) are sufficiently far apart to have negligible interaction. The reactant state (R) is a physisorbed structure in which an HF or TMA molecule is adsorbed to the surface without forming new covalent bonds. The transition state (TS) is the highest energy configuration along the reaction coordinate connecting R and P. The product state (P) represents the configuration after a surface reaction. The unbound product state (UP) represents the configuration in which the reacted surface and the byproduct molecule are sufficiently far apart to have negligible interaction. All structural data from this study are available in a public repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>The physisorption energy (E phy,n ), reaction energy (ΔE n ), activation energy (E A,n ), and byproduct desorption energy (E des,n ) for the n th step of fluorination or removal reaction were calculated using the following equations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E ads,n = E Rn -E URn = E Rn - ( E slab,n + E gas )<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">ΔE n = E Pn -E Rn (3) E A,n = E TSn -E Rn (4) E des,n = E UPn -E Pn = ( E reacted slab, n + ∑ E byproduct ) -E Pn (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where E URn , E Rn , E Pn , E TSn , and E UPn are the system energies of UR, R, P, TS, and UP of the n th fluorination and removal reaction, respectively.

E gas and E byproduct are the energies of the isolated HF or TMA molecule and the resulting isolated byproduct molecules, respectively. To mimic the bulk material during the surface reaction, atoms in the bottom layer, which is approximately a quarter of the total thickness, were constrained during geometry optimization, while all other atoms were allowed to relax fully. Thermodynamic quantities were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of the reaction at relevant temperatures. The standard enthalpy (H • ) and Gibbs free energy (G • ) were calculated as functions of temperature (T) based on the electronic energy (E) at 0 K by the following equations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Construction of amorphous Al 2 O 3 substrate models</head><p>To construct the amorphous Al 2 O 3 models required to simulate surface reactions, a crystalline alpha-Al 2 O 3 structure with a density of 3.99 g/cm 3 was used as the starting structure. The lattice parameters were isotropically expanded to obtain a density of 3.00 g/cm 3 , corresponding to the values typically observed in amorphous alumina films deposited by ALD at 450 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. An expanded 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of alpha-Al 2 O 3 (Al 48 O 72 ) was then constructed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>.</p><p>The amorphization process of the expanded alpha-Al 2 O 3 was performed by the melt-quench method using AIMD simulations. Starting from a crystalline configuration in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a), the model was heated and equilibrated at 5000 K, a temperature significantly above the experimental melting point of alpha-Al 2 O 3 (2344 K). The system was held at 5000 K for 5 ps to ensure complete melting. The successful transition to a disordered liquid state was confirmed by the following indicators: an apparent loss of long-range order compared to the initial crystalline phase, quantitative agreement in short-range structural features with experimental data for molten Al 2 O 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and the liquid-like behavior of the radial distribution function (RDF) spectra in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>, where the tail approaches unity beyond approximately 5 Å <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In addition, analysis of the mean squared displacement (MSD) of atoms in Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref> confirms that atomic mobility becomes diffusive and unrestricted at 5000 K after approximately 1 ps, providing further evidence for liquid-like behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Following the 5 ps melting period at 5000 K, the molten Al 2 O 3 was quenched to obtain an amorphous structure. To ensure the final amorphous structure was not overly sensitive to the specific cooling procedure, the effect of different quenching protocols was evaluated by analyzing the RDFs and Al coordination number distributions of the generated models. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>(a) and Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> show that the choice of quenching protocol had minimal effect on the main structural features of the final amorphous Al 2 O 3 .</p><p>The structural variability among independently generated amorphous samples was also investigated. Ten amorphous Al 2 O 3 samples were generated using slightly different quenching conditions. The molten structure was quenched to 3000 K and held for different durations ranging from 1 to 3 ps, followed by subsequent quenching to 1500 K. Despite the variations in the intermediate hold time at 3000 K, these samples exhibited highly consistent RDF peak positions and similar Al coordination number distributions, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>(a) and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>. ~1.83 Å in our model, which is in good agreement with the experimental values of 1.75 Å for the ALD film <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and 1.80 Å for the anodized film <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Minor discrepancies between simulated and experimental RDFs can result from differences in material properties, particularly the incorporation of impurities. For example, ALD-grown alumina films using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H 2 O at ~200 • C typically contain 3-4 at% hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which can affect the local bonding environment and overall structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In contrast, ALD films deposited with TMA and O 3 at higher temperatures, such as 400 • C, which are more representative of alumina films in semiconductor manufacturing processes, have negligible hydrogen content <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Recognizing that many advanced semiconductor applications require hydrogen-free alumina, our study focused on deliberately constructing a hydrogen-free amorphous alumina structure. As a result, our amorphous model shows greater structural similarity to the hydrogen-free anodized alumina reported in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> than to the hydrogen-containing ALD film in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>The second broad peak in the RDF, centered at about 3.0 Å in our model, corresponds to second-nearest-neighbor correlations, primarily Al-Al and O-O pair distances. In our model, the average Al-Al and O-O distances are 3.11 Å and 2.74 Å, respectively, which is in good agreement with the values from the ALD film (3.00 Å and 2.70 Å) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and the anodized film (3.20 Å and 2.80 Å) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. A notable difference, however, is the significantly larger intensity of this second peak in the experimental RDFs compared to our simulated RDF, indicating a higher degree of medium-range order (MRO) in the experimentally prepared amorphous structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. This enhanced MRO is due to the much slower cooling rates typically used in the experimental fabrication of amorphous Al 2 O 3 , on the order of seconds or minutes, compared to the rapid quenching rates used in AIMD simulations, which are on the order of picoseconds. Slower cooling allows for more extensive structural relaxation and promotes the development of MRO, resulting in an increased intensity of the second RDF peak <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the coordination number distributions of Al atoms in our amorphous model and compares them with data from an experimental amorphous film, crystalline Al 2 O 3 phases, and other reported AIMD models. Our amorphous model exhibits predominantly four-(52 %) and five-coordinated (46 %) Al atoms, with a small fraction of six-coordinated Al atoms (2 %), similar to that observed in an amorphous ALD film <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and other AIMD models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. This is in sharp contrast to the crystalline forms in which alpha-Al 2 O 3 has exclusively six-coordinated Al atoms, while theta-Al 2 O 3 has equal proportions of four-and six-coordinated Al atoms.</p><p>To prepare a-Al 2 O 3 slab models suitable for simulating the ALE reaction, the bulk amorphized Al 48 O 72 structure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c</ref>) was cleaved along the (0001) plane of the initial alpha-alumina structure. As a result, the amorphous Al 40 O 60 slab model with smooth surfaces was prepared. This idealized smooth surface is considered a reasonable starting point for our simulations. For reference, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements on ALD alumina films have reported an RMS surface roughness of 0.148 nm before and 0.135 nm after thermal ALE using HF and TMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, indicating that our smooth-surfaced slab models provide a reasonable representation of the actual amorphous Al 2 O 3 film.</p><p>To accurately model the surface chemistry, the surfaces of the amorphous Al 40 O 60 slab were passivated. First, five -OH surface groups were introduced to the terminal Al atoms, and five H atoms were attached to the O atoms on both the top and bottom surfaces of the slab, resulting in the formation of five terminal OH (Al-OH*) and five bridging OH (Al-O(H*)-Al) groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Fluorination of amorphous aluminum oxide by HF</head><p>We simulated the sequential fluorination steps of a-Al 2 O 3 with HF, forming AlF 3 and volatile byproducts. Due to the complex and disordered nature of the amorphous model, multiple potential reaction pathways were explored for each fluorination step. This approach is analogous to the methodology used in our previous publication on amorphous silicon nitride <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.  H 2 O (P1a), AlOH 2 * (P1b), or AlOH* (P1c), respectively. In addition, the reaction of HF with the Al-CH 3 * of the TMA-treated surface of Fig. 5(b) was simulated, resulting in the formation of AlF* and CH 4 (P1d). In the second fluorination step, HF is assumed to react with AlO(H)*-AlF or Al 2 O*-AlF of Fig. 5(c) to form AlF 2 * and AlOH 2 * (P2a) or Al 2 OH* (P2b). The reactions to form P2a and P2b are mechanistically analogous to those to form P1b and P1c in the initial fluorination step, respectively. For the third fluorination step, HF was assumed to react with AlO*-AlF 2 of Fig. 5(d) to form -AlF 3 * (P3a) or a gaseous AlF 3 molecule (P3b) together with AlOH*. Finally, the reaction of HF with the subsurface Al 2 O 3 layer under -AlF 3 * is considered, resulting in the formation of OAl-OH* and F-AlF 3 * (P4).</p><p>Most of the pathways leading to the formation of surface-bound AlF 3 * (P1a, P1b, P1c, P1d, P2a, P3a, P4) are calculated to be exothermic with relatively low activation energies. In addition, the calculated Gibbs free energy changes at 250 • C for these pathways are also negative, indicating that sequential surface fluorination to form AlF 3 * is thermodynamically favorable at this temperature. In contrast, the direct formation of gaseous AlF 3 in P3b is significantly less favorable.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the changes in atomistic structures for four investigated pathways for the initial fluorination of a-Al 2 O 3 by HF. In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the label "H" refers to the hydrogen atom originating from the attacking HF molecule, and the dashed lines represent the important interatomic distances in Å. The reaction involving the release of H 2 O from O 3 Al-OH* by HF (P1a) was calculated to be exothermic with a ΔE of -0.35 eV. This exothermicity is attributed to the favorable energy balance from the formation of strong Al-F (7.43 eV) and O-H (5.13 eV) bonds, which outweighs the energy required to break the H-F (6.02 eV <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>) and surface Al-O (5.94 eV) bonds. The bond dissociation energies were calculated using slab models or gas molecules. In TS1a, the HF molecule interacts with the O 3 Al-OH* group to form a strained four-membered ring-like geometry (-Al-O-H-F-). The Al-F and O-H bonds are stretched to 2.04 Å and 1.32 Å, respectively, while the H-F and Al-O bonds are stretched by 0.10 Å and 0.13 Å, respectively, from their initial states.

Based on Eq. (10), H 2 O desorption is predicted to become spontaneous at temperatures above 103 • C, primarily due to the increase in entropy during gas formation. The reaction of HF with AlO(H*)-Al (P1b) was also found to be exothermic with ΔE of -0.22 eV. Similar to P1a, this exothermicity is driven by the formation of Al-F and O-H bonds, offsetting the dissociation of H-F and Al-O bonds. In TS1b, an F atom of the incoming HF molecule bonds with an Al atom of AlO(H*)-Al to form an elongated Al-F bond (2.01 Å) without bond dissociation. The Al-O bond involved in the reaction was elongated by 0.25 Å compared to its initial state. The relatively low E A of 0.65 eV was probably due to the formation of the Al-F bond despite the strain introduced by the elongation of the Al-O bond. The chemisorbed H 2 O molecule in P1b subsequently desorbs to form Al-F-Al in UP1b with an E des of 1.27 eV, which is predicted by Eq. (10) to occur spontaneously at temperatures higher than 142 • C. The dissociative chemisorption of HF on the AlO-Al (P1c) was also calculated to be exothermic with ΔE of -0.42 eV due to the formation of Al-F and O-H bonds despite the dissociation of H-F and the generation of over-coordination of O atoms. In TS1c, the elongated O-H bond (1.10 Å) is formed, while the H-F and Al-O bonds are stretched by 0.22 and 0.58 Å, respectively. No dissociated bond was observed, contributing to the very low E A of 0.18 eV. The reaction involving the release of CH 4 from O 3 Al-CH 3 * by HF (P1d) is the most exothermic of the initial fluorination pathways, with a ΔE of -1.52 eV due to the formation of Al-F (7.43 eV) and C-H (4.59 eV) bonds overcoming the dissociation energies of H-F (6.02 eV [42]) and Al-C (4.00 eV) bonds. The higher exothermicity of this process compared to the release of H 2 O (P1a) is mainly due to the significantly weaker Al-C bond compared to the Al-O bond. In TS1d, the F atom of HF begins to bond to an Al atom of O 3 Al-CH 3 * without cleavage of a covalent bond. An elongated Al-F bond of 2.06 Å is observed, and the Al-C bond is extended from 1.96 Å to 2.15 Å. The relatively low E A of 1.14 eV was calculated. The desorption of the byproduct CH 4 is endothermic with an E des of 0.17 eV and is predicted by Eq. (10) to be spontaneous at temperatures higher than -159 • C, suggesting easy desorption at the experimental temperature of 250 • C. Overall, all four initial fluorination pathways (P1a, P1b, P1c, P1d) by HF involving cleavage of Al-O or Al-C were calculated to be exothermic with relatively low E A ranging from 0.18 eV to 1.14 eV. Furthermore, the ΔG values at 250 • C were all negative, indicating that the first fluorination step is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible at the experimental ALE temperature of 250 • C. Fig. 7 illustrates the changes in atomistic structures for the two pathways investigated for the second fluorination step by HF. The cleavage of the Al-O bond of AlO(H*)-AlF* to form AlF 2 * (P2a) is exothermic with a ΔE of -0.58 eV. Pathway P2a involves similar bond changes as the analogous initial pathway P1b but is more exothermic, mainly due to the lower physisorption energy in R2a than in R1b. In TS2a, the F atom of HF is bonded to an Al atom of AlO(H*)-AlF*, while an Al-O bond is dissociated. An elongated Al-F bond (2.00 Å) was formed, and the H-F bond was slightly extended by 0.06 Å. The low E A of 0.58 eV is mainly due to the energy gained from the formation of the Al-F bond, which compensates for the energy cost of dissociating the Al-O bond. A chemisorbed H 2 O molecule in the P2a state would desorb and form an additional Al-F bond in UP2a with an E des of 1.10 eV. The dissociative chemisorption of HF on Al 2 O*-AlF* (P2b) was also calculated to be exothermic with a ΔE of -0.39 eV. Since the triplebridged oxygen atom in R2b is more stable than the double-bridged oxygen in the analogous R1c pathway, the reaction to P2b is less exothermic than that of P1c (ΔE=-0.42 eV). In TS2b, the HF molecule is attached to Al 2 O*-AlF*, forming a four-membered ring-like geometry analogous to that observed in TS1a. Stretched Al-F (1.90 Å) and O-H (1.29 Å) bonds are observed, and the H-F and Al-O bonds are extended by approximately 0.18 Å. These structural changes correspond to a low E A of 0.50 eV. Overall, both second fluorination pathways (P2a and P2b) are exothermic, driven mainly by the formation of a strong Al-F bond, similar to the first fluorination step. The low E A values of 0.58 and 0.50 eV suggest that the fluorinations are kinetically accessible at moderate temperatures. At 250 • C, the cleavage of AlO(H*)-AlF is predicted to be spontaneous. On the other hand, the cleavage of Al 2 O*-AlF shows a slightly positive ΔG of 0.13 eV, mainly due to the decrease in entropy. Nevertheless, we considered the P2b pathway plausible because -AlF 2 * of P2b is readily consumed in the subsequent third fluorination step by the reaction from R3a to P3a, as discussed in the following section. Fig. 8 illustrates the changes in atomistic structures for two representative pathways for the third fluorination step by HF. The formation of -AlF 3 * by HF (P3a) is more exothermic (ΔE=-0.95 eV) than analogous pathways in the first (P1b) and second (P2a) steps, mainly due to the lower physisorption energy in R3a than in R1b and R2a. In TS3a, the F atom from the incoming HF molecule is bonded to the Al atom of the Al 2 O-Al(F 2 *)O(H)Al, while the Al-O bond is cleaved. The formation of an Al-F bond with a length of 1.83 Å is observed, while the H-F bond is stretched by 0.09 Å. The relatively low E A of 0.83 eV is attributed to the energy gained from the partial formation of an Al-F bond, which partially compensates for the energy required to dissociate the Al-O bond and stretch the H-F bond. The alternative third fluorination pathway, involving the direct release of an AlF 3 molecule from the surface (P3b), was calculated to be highly endothermic with ΔE of 1.58 eV due to the considerable energy cost of dissociating two Al-F and one Al-O bonds despite the energy Overall, the formation of surface-bound -OAlF 3 * (P3a) is a spontaneous process with a low E A . In contrast, the direct release of AlF 3 molecules (P3b) at 250 • C is predicted to be thermodynamically unfavorable, despite the increase in entropy, because it is highly endothermic.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the changes in atomistic structure during the fluorination by HF of the subsurface region located beneath the surface -AlF 3 * groups. The reaction of HF with OAlO(H)-AlF 3 * in R4 to form FAlF 3 * and OAlOH* in P4 was calculated to be exothermic with a ΔE of -0.21 eV. In TS4, an Al-F bond with a stretched length of 1.94 Å is formed, an Al-O bond in the subsurface dissociates, and the H-F bond is slightly stretched by 0.02 Å. These structural changes result in a low E A of 0.82 eV. After the reaction to form P4, an H 2 O molecule can desorb from the surface to form OAl-F-AlF 3 in UP4 with an E des of 0.79 eV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Construction of amorphous AlF 3 substrate models</head><p>Amorphous AlF 3 substrate models were constructed using a method similar to that described for the amorphous Al 2 O 3 models. The starting structure was alpha-AlF 3 , with an experimental bulk density of 3.26 g/ cm 3 . Before melting, the lattice dimensions were isotropically increased to adjust the model density to 2.90 g/cm³, which was chosen to match the reported density of amorphous AlF 3 films deposited by ALD at 423 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A 2 × 2 × 1 expanded alpha-AlF 3 supercell (Al 24 F 72 ) was then constructed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(a)</ref>.</p><p>The amorphous structure was generated by the melt-quench method via AIMD simulation. The heating and initial cooling steps were identical to the a-Al 2 O 3 case, but an additional 1 ps duration at 750 K was added at the end of the cooling protocol due to the lower melting point of AlF 3 compared to Al 2 O 3 . The successful transition to the liquid state during the melting phase was confirmed by criteria analogous to those used for a-Al 2 O 3 , that is, comparison of the RDF of molten AlF 3 with that of alpha AlF 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>) and analysis of the atomic displacement evolution during the simulation (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). The influence of different quenching protocols on the final amorphous AlF 3 structure was found to be minimal, as evidenced by the consistent RDFs shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4(b</ref>). Furthermore, ten independent amorphous AlF 3 samples generated by quenching a molten structure at 3000 K for different durations ranging from 1 to 3 ps, followed by quenching to 1500 K and then to 750 K, exhibited consistent RDF peak positions as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5(b)</ref>, indicating low structural variability among independently generated samples. This suggests that a single representative sample may be sufficient to represent the structural properties of amorphous AlF 3 . The amorphized structure of such a representative sample (#1 from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5(b)</ref>) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(b</ref>). Finally, this as-quenched structure was fully geometry optimized at 0 K using DFT calculations, resulting in the final structure of a-AlF 3 shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(c)</ref>.</p><p>To simulate the ALE reaction on a-AlF 3 substrates, the amorphized bulk structure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(c</ref>) was cleaved along the (0001) plane of the  initial alpha AlF 3 structure, resulting in the Al 24 F 72 slab model with relatively smooth surfaces. To mimic the AlF 3 surface after HF exposure, three F atoms were attached to the surface-exposed Al atoms, forming Al-F* groups, while three H atoms were attached to the F atoms on the top and bottom surfaces of the slab model, forming Al-FH* groups. A vacuum region of 20 Å was inserted between the periodic slabs.</p><p>The optimal surface coverage of -FH* groups on the top surface was determined by simulating the spontaneous release of HF molecules, analogous to the -OH* optimization performed for the a-Al 2 O 3 model. The changes in the atomistic structures are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. The release of the first HF molecule from the model, initially containing three -FH* groups, was calculated to be exothermic with ΔE of -0.11 eV. In contrast, the subsequent releases of the additional HF molecules were found to be endothermic, with ΔE of 0.49 and 0.71 eV, respectively. Despite their endothermic nature, these HF desorption events are predicted to occur spontaneously at temperatures above -30 and 129 • C, respectively. Therefore, we expected no residual -FH* groups on the a-AlF 3 surface at the ALE processing temperature of 250 • C. The presence of minimal HF molecules on the fluorinated Al 2 O 3 surface has been observed after exposure to HF at 200 • C or higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, which supports our prediction. The final a-AlF 3 substrate model, representing the surface after complete fluorination by HF, consists of 24 Al and 72 F atoms, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12(a)</ref>.</p><p>Considering that the removal reaction by TMA is also a multistep process, a -CH 3 * terminated AlF 3 substrate model was also prepared by replacing the surface F atoms with CH 3 groups to simulate the second step of the removal reaction, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12(b</ref>). After this modification, the -CH 3 * terminated a-AlF 3 substrate model was subjected to geometry optimization by DFT calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Removal reactions of amorphous AlF 3 by TMA</head><p>For the removal reactions of a-AlF 3 by TMA, we assumed that dimethylaluminum fluoride (Al(CH 3 ) 2 F, DMAF) would be the primary aluminum-containing volatile byproduct molecules. Both TMA and   DMAF are known to exist as either monomers or dimers, depending on the temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. To determine the likely state of these species under typical ALE conditions, we predicted the degree of dimer dissociation for TMA and DMAF in the gas phase as a function of temperature using DFT, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>. The total pressures of TMA and DMAF were assumed to be 1 and 0.01 Torr, respectively, representing typical precursor and by-product partial pressures. At 250 • C, the TMA dimer was predicted to dissociate almost completely into monomers, so TMA was treated as a monomer in subsequent calculations. On the other hand, the dissociation behavior of DMAF dimers depends on their bridging structure. Three dimer structures of DMAF were considered, each with two F-bridges, one F-bridge and one CH 3 -bridge, and two CH 3 -bridges. DFT calculations indicated that at 250 • C, less than 5 % of DMAF molecules with two F-bridges are predicted to dissociate, while those with other structures would dissociate completely. Therefore, when two DMAF monomers meet at 250 • C, they are likely to form a DMAF dimer with two F-bridges.</p><p>We then simulated the two-step removal reaction of a-AlF 3 by two successive TMA molecules, forming a monomer or dimer of DMAF, as shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref> shows the corresponding changes in the atomistic structure. In the first removal step (P5), an incoming TMA monomer reacts with -AlF* to form -Al(CH 3 )* and release a DMAF monomer. This reaction was calculated to be exothermic with a ΔE of -0.51 eV, primarily because the newly formed Al-F bond in DMAF (7.19 eV) is stronger than the original Al-F bond in a-AlF 3 (7.03 eV), despite no change in the net number of bond types. In TS5, the Al atom of TMA bonds to the F atom of -AlF* to form an elongated Al-F bond of 2.07 Å, while an original subsurface Al-F bond is dissociated. As a result, a low E A of 0.23 eV was obtained because there was no net change in bond types.</p><p>In the second removal step (R6), a second TMA molecule reacts with (Al-F) 3 -AlCH 3 *, a surface site created in R5, releasing a DMAF dimer as a volatile byproduct. Similar to the first step (P5), this reaction was calculated to be exothermic with ΔE of -0.24 eV. The exothermicity is primarily attributed to the formation of a stable dimer despite no net bond change. In TS6, the incoming TMA molecule interacts with the surface, dissociating three Al-F bonds from a-AlF 3 and nearly forming two new Al-F bonds that will become part of the desorbing DMAF dimer. The calculated E A for this step was 1.08 eV.</p><p>We also modeled several potential reactions between a DMAF monomer and another DMAF monomer, TMA, or DMAF dimer on the surface to form a DMAF dimer (Al 2 F 2 (CH 3 ) 4 ), DMAF-TMA complex (Al 2 F (CH 3 ) 5 ), or DMAF trimer (Al 3 F 3 (CH 3 ) 6 ), respectively, as shown in Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>. The changes in atomistic structure are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>. Both reactions between a DMAF monomer with another DMAF monomer and a DMAF dimer are exothermic and spontaneous at 250 • C with ΔG of -0.23 and -0.08 eV, respectively, indicating that the dimerization and trimerization of DMAF on the surface are favorable. The reaction between DMAF and TMA monomers is also exothermic. However, its ΔG value at 250 • C is slightly positive, suggesting that a higher TMA precursor pressure than our assumption is required to form Al 2 F(CH 3 ) 5 . These results explain the detection of Al 2 F 2 (CH 3 ) 4 , Al 2 F(CH 3 ) 5 , and Al 3 F 3 (CH 3 ) 6 and the absence of the DMAF monomer in the QMS spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The removal of an AlF 3 layer during ALE eventually exposes the underlying oxyfluoride interface region between AlF 3 and bulk Al 2 O 3 . Therefore, we also simulated the removal reactions of the oxyfluoride by TMA, as summarized in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Two types of surface groups of -OAlF 3 * and -O 2 AlF 2 * represent the oxyfluorides on a-Al 2 O 3 with high and low fluorine densities, respectively. The changes in atomistic structure are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">S7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S8</ref>. For the high fluorine density site of -OAlF 3 *, the two-step removal reaction was exothermic and spontaneous at 250 • C. The first step (P7) has a very low E A of 0.03 eV, while the second step (P8) has a higher E A of 1.15 eV. This indicates that TMA can remove AlF 3 from -OAlF 3 *, although the overall reaction would be slower than that with a-AlF 3 due to the higher barrier for P8 (1.15 eV) compared to that for P6 on pure a-AlF 3 (1.08 eV).</p><p>In contrast, the removal reaction from the lower fluorine density oxyfluoride site of -O 2 AlF 2 * proceeds differently. Although the first TMA reaction step (P9) is exothermic, spontaneous at 250 • C, and has a low E A of 0.29 eV, the second step (P10) was calculated to be endothermic and nonspontaneous at 250 • C. Furthermore, P10 has a relatively high E A of 1.69 eV. These results suggest that the reaction of TMA with -O 2 AlF 2 * would only replace fluorine with a -CH 3 group without removing Al atoms from the substrate.</p><p>The results of our DFT calculations indicate that the removal of the a-AlF 3 layer and highly fluorinated oxyfluoride sites by TMA is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically accessible at 250 • C, resulting in the release of both the monomer and dimer of DMAF. Conversely, the removal of Al from less fluorinated oxyfluoride sites is thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically hindered at 250 • C, resulting in the formation of -CH 3 * termination on the surface instead of etching. Therefore, the overall removal reaction is predicted to be self-limiting, as TMA effectively removes AlF 3 and highly fluorinated oxyfluoride layers, but the etching reaction stops upon encountering the less fluorinated oxide interface. In addition, this result explains the increase in the CH 3 peak observed in the FTIR spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and the detection of carbon in the film by XPS spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> after TMA exposure during Al 2 O 3 ALE.</p><p>In summary, our DFT calculation provides comprehensive mechanistic insights that successfully explain the thermal ALE of alumina films by HF and TMA. This study highlights the importance of using amorphous slab models with optimized surface group densities to simulate the etching process accurately. Key mechanistic findings include the plausibility of multilayer AlF 3 formation extending beyond the immediate surface during the HF fluorination step, as well as the energetic Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>.

The detailed modeling approach presented in this study provides a foundation that can be extended to study the thermal ALE processes of other metal oxide films.</p><p>However, this study was primarily based on time-independent DFT calculations at 0 K, and the free energy at elevated temperatures was estimated using vibrational properties. As a result, the dynamic process, such as the diffusion of HF or complex surface reconstructions occurring on longer time scales, could not be elucidated. The study of such phenomena would require large-scale calculations using methods such as MD simulations. However, the development and validation of reliable interatomic potentials for these fluorine-containing material systems remain important challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The mechanism of thermal ALE of aluminum oxide by HF and TMA was investigated using DFT calculations. Amorphous Al 2 O 3 and AlF 3 slab models were constructed through AIMD melt-quench simulations, optimized by DFT calculations, and used to simulate successive fluorination by HF and subsequent removal reactions by TMA. The slab models were passivated by surface groups with optimized surface coverage. The main fluorination pathways leading to the formation of multilayer AlF 3 were calculated to be spontaneous at 250 • C, with low activation energies ranging from 0.18 to 1.14 eV, releasing H 2 O and CH 4 gases as volatile byproducts. Similarly, the removal reactions on a-AlF 3 by TMA, releasing the dimer of the DMAF molecule, were also found to be spontaneous at 250 • C with low activation energies up to 1.08 eV. The results indicate that the thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 is thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible at 250 • C. In addition, the removal of Al from less fluorinated oxyfluoride sites by TMA was nonspontaneous, with a high activation energy of 1.69 eV, indicating that the removal step is a self-limiting process. These results align well with experimental observations from in situ QMS, FTIR, and XPS in the literature. Our DFT calculations using realistic amorphous slab models successfully explain the fundamental surface chemistry governing the thermal ALE of aluminum oxide films.</p></div>

However, further dehydroxylation was endothermic with ΔE of 0.55 eV and E des of 0.91 eV, making it nonspontaneous at temperatures below 319 • C, assuming an H 2 O pressure of 1 Torr. Therefore, the number of -OH groups on the top surface was set to six for simulations at the ALE process temperature of 250 • C. An equivalent coverage of six -OH groups was also formed on the bottom surface. The final -OH terminated a-Al 2 O 3 substrate model shown in Fig. 5(a) consists of 40 Al atoms, 66 O atoms, and 12 H atoms, corresponding to a surface -OH density of 6.3 OH/nm 2 . For comparison, an amorphous film deposited by ALD at 125 • C has a surface -OH density of 8 OH/nm 2 [40]. It has also been reported that the surface -OH density of an amorphous film deposited by ALD at 250 • C decreased by 25 % when the annealing temperature was increased from 125 • C to 250 • C [41], which is consistent with the conditions modeled in this study. In addition, to mimic surfaces exposed to TMA in the second or subsequent ALE cycles, a -CH 3 terminated surface was also constructed. Since no C-O bond peak was observed in the FTIR spectra after TMA exposure [4], only terminal -OH* groups on the model shown in Fig. 5(a) were replaced by two -CH 3 groups, while the Al-O(H*)-groups were retained. The resulting -CH 3 terminated surface is shown in Fig. 5(b).</figDesc></figure>

The -AlF* surface groups were formed by cleavage of the Al-O bonds in the terminal -Al-OH*, bridging -Al-O(H*)-, or backbone -Al-O-linkages, and termination of the Al with F. The -AlF 2 * surface groups were formed by further fluorination of partially fluorinated species such as -Al(F*)-O(H*)-or -Al(F*)-O-by cleavage of Al-O bonds. The -AlF 3 * groups were also formed by further fluorination of AlF 2 * in -Al(F 2 *)-O(H*)-or -Al(F 2 *)-O-by cleavage of Al-O bonds. However, due to steric hindrance, only half of the -AlF 2 * groups could be converted to -AlF 3 *. Finally, all fluorinated substrate models were fully geometry optimized using DFT calculations to obtain energetically stable configurations.</figDesc></figure>
