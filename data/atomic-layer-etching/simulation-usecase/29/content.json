Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a well- established technique that uses sequential, self- limiting surface reactions to deposit thin films with excellent conformality and atomicscale thickness control [1]. Complementary to ALD, atomic layer etching (ALE) uses sequential surface modification and removal steps, which can be partially or fully self- limiting, allowing material removal with atomic precision [2]. ALE is broadly categorized into plasma ALE and thermal ALE. Plasma ALE is inherently anisotropic because it relies on ion bombardment to remove the modified layer. In contrast, thermal ALE is isotropic because it uses chemical reactions to form and remove the modified layer.",

Minor discrepancies between simulated and experimental RDFs can result from differences in material properties, particularly the incorporation of impurities. For example, ALD- grown alumina films using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and  $\\mathrm{H_2O}$  at  $\\sim 200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  typically contain 3- 4 at% hydrogen [34], which can affect the local bonding environment and overall structure [34]. In contrast, ALD films deposited with TMA and  $\\mathrm{O_3}$  at higher temperatures, such as  $400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , which are more representative of alumina films in semiconductor manufacturing processes, have negligible hydrogen content [34]. Recognizing that many advanced semiconductor applications require hydrogen- free alumina, our study focused on deliberately constructing a hydrogen- free amorphous alumina structure. As a result, our amorphous model shows greater structural similarity to the hydrogen- free anodized alumina reported in Ref. [33] than to the hydrogen- containing ALD film in Ref. [32].",

A notable difference, however, is the significantly larger intensity of this second peak in the experimental RDFs compared to our simulated RDF, indicating a higher degree of medium- range order (MRO) in the experimentally prepared amorphous structures [35]. This enhanced MRO is due to the much slower cooling rates typically used in the experimental fabrication of amorphous  $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ , on the order of seconds or minutes, compared to the rapid quenching rates used in AIMD simulations, which are on the order of picoseconds. Lower cooling allows for more extensive structural relaxation and promotes the development of MRO, resulting in an increased intensity of the second RDF peak [36].",
