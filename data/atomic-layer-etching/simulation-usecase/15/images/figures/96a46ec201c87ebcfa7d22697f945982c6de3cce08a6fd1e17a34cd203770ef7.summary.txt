The scatter plot compares the etch per cycle (Å/cycle) against Ar⁺ irradiation time (s). The simulation results are represented by red circles, while the experimental results are shown by blue squares. The trend suggests that as Ar⁺ irradiation increases, the etch per cycle generally increases, with both simulation and experiment showing similar trends.
