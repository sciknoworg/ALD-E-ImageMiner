The line charts display the density of Si and Cl atoms at different Z positions across various cycles (Cl₂ Cycle 1, Cl₂ Cycle 4, Cl₂ Cycle 8, Ar⁺ Cycle 1, Ar⁺ Cycle 4, Ar⁺ Cycle 8). The density values are plotted against the Z position in angstroms (Å), showing fluctuations that may indicate changes in the distribution of atoms within the system.
