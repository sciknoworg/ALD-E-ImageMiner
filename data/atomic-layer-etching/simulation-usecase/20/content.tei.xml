<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A combined computational and experimental study is employed to understand the competition between self-limiting (SL) and chemical vapor etch (CVE) reactions to design an atomic layer etch (ALE) process. The pulses in an ALE process have to be self-limiting; i.e., the reactions should reach saturation after sufficient pulse time. By comparing the reaction free energies of corresponding SL and CVE reactions using density functional theory (DFT), the temperature and pressure conditions can be predicted that favor the SL or CVE reactions. The etching of TiO 2 when exposed to HF gas is utilized as a test case. Simulations reveal that when TiO 2 is exposed to reactant HF at a pressure of 0.2 Torr, the SL reaction removing H 2 O at 0.01 Torr and fluorinating the surface is preferred up to 87 °C (360 K). At higher temperatures, continuous removal of TiO 2 by CVE occurs according to the reaction TiO 2 + HF → TiF 4 + H 2 O subject to kinetic activation barriers. Experimental results from in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) are compared with the theoretical predictions. In good agreement with theory, the FTIR spectroscopy studies revealed an onset of spontaneous etching (CVE) at temperatures around 80-90 °C. In addition, the QMS analysis observed TiF 4 and H 2 O as the etch products, further validating the calculations. The calculations also predicted that an increase in the reactant gas pressure would enhance etching at high temperatures. The low computational cost of this theoretical approach allows for rapid screening of etch reagents and prediction of the temperature/pressure windows where the reactions will be in the SL or CVE regimes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Materials may be processed reliably and uniformly with atomic level control by exploiting self-limiting gas-surface reactions. For instance, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a process in which a precise fraction of a monolayer of material is deposited in each cycle of gas pulses via a sequence of self-limiting (SL) surface reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> ALD has become an indispensable step in the fabrication of modern semiconductor devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Alternatively, materials may be deposited faster, but with less control, by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which is a spontaneous and continuous process.</p><p>A sequence of SL reactions is also the basis for the atomic layer etch (ALE) process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ALE is expanding in scope to become a key enabling technology for the fabrication of next generation semiconductor devices. In some cases, combining ALD and ALE will be advantageous for the production of ultrasmooth thin films only on selected substrates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> This areaselectivity could reduce the number of lithographic steps and allow further size reduction in semiconductor devices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> The challenge is to identify SL chemistries, or more precisely, to identify reagents and reaction conditions for the desired SL reaction. This paper presents a combined experimental and computational approach for meeting this challenge.</p><p>In the ALE concept, the target material surface is first chemically modified by exposure to a pulse of a suitable gas reactant that self-limits after forming a nonvolatile surface layer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The modified layer is then volatilized by the action of the second reactant pulse. Plasma ALE employs directional (i.e., anisotropic) high energy ion bombardment in the second pulse to remove the modified surface layer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Thermal isotropic ALE processes have also recently been introduced where the modified layer is removed by chemical reaction with another gas phase reactant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The second reactant may then remove the entire modified layer in a continuous, unlimited way, but it self-limits upon reaching the unmodified material underneath.</p><p>Modification of the surface by the first reactant is the subject of this study. The first reactant is introduced into the etch chamber as a gas and adsorbs onto the substrate material by binding with the surface atoms. A volatile byproduct may be produced at this stage. If some fragment of the reactant passivates the surface and causes the surface to become inert toward further reactant adsorption, then this is an SL reaction, as required for ALE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> On the other hand, the adsorbate could continue to react with the substrate by diffusing into and reacting with subsurface layers. This process would result in continual formation of volatile byproducts that desorb and regenerate active sites on the surface. This spontaneous reaction would be a CVE process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Thermochemical calculations of model reactions have been performed by researchers investigating ALD and ALE processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> One popular approach is to model the reactions using thermochemical tables from databases such as NIST-JANAF <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> with the help of software packages such as the HSC Chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> Alternatively, reactions can be modeled from first-principles using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Such calculations have been used to investigate ALD mechanism in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> and recently also to study thermal ALE with HF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> One advantage of using firstprinciples calculations is that any specific phase of a solid system or any gas phase molecule of interest, however exotic, can be modeled explicitly by ab initio methods. In addition, databases typically include only bulk materials, and so the calculated thermochemistry is valid only for bulk deposition or etching, and not for the surface reactions.</p><p>Applying DFT to a slab model is the standard computational procedure for investigating material surfaces, including their interaction with gas phase molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> This approach can be used to model the SL reaction. By comparing the free energy profiles (FEPs) of CVE and SL reactions using the "Natarajan-Elliott" analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> the nature of a reactant pulse can be understood. From this analysis, a "minimum thermodynamic barrier" to etch is computed, which is the difference between the corresponding reaction free energies of the CVE and SL reactions. Four distinct reaction states are identified based on the value of this "minimum thermodynamic barrier". These states are purely self-limiting, preferred selflimiting, preferred etching, and purely etching. A detailed description of this analysis methodology is given elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> TiO 2 has significant applications in a variety of technological fields. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> For example, TiO 2 is an important photocatalyst and has been explored for the production of hydrogen and selfcleaning surfaces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> TiO 2 is also a key material in semiconductor devices such as metal-oxide resistive random access memory (RRAM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> Thin films of TiO 2 are also used in mirror coatings, orthopedic implants and pharmacological applications. A great number of examples are available where thin films of TiO 2 have been deposited using the ALD approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> HF has been used as the fluorinating agent in the thermal ALE of several metal oxides such as Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 and ZrO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> However, HF was found to be unsuitable in the thermal ALE of TiO 2 where the Ti atoms are in an oxidation state of +4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> TiO 2 is spontaneously etched by HF at temperatures greater than 200 °C, probably forming gaseous TiF 4 and H 2 O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> However, when WF 6 was used as the fluorination reactant at lower temperatures below 170 °C, TiO 2 ALE was possible using WF 6 and BCl 3 without the spontaneous etching of TiO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> Therefore, HF exposure on TiO 2 presents an excellent test case for investigating the competition between self-limiting and spontaneous etch reactions.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and validate a combined computational and experimental approach for the design of new ALE processes. The main design steps are (1) choosing reactant molecules for each pulse, (2) optimizing the process conditions in terms of temperature and reactant gas pressure, and (3) identifying and treating the exhaust gases. In a purely experimental approach, each design choice is evaluated by trial and error in the laboratory. This is a time intensive process that limits the number of options that can be considered. On the other hand, a purely computer-based design can consider a much larger range of molecules. However, the computational model may not be able to include all the variables. A closely coupled combination of computations to narrow down the design choices and experiments to optimize the reaction conditions may provide the best strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODS SECTION</head><p>II.A. Computational Methods. The calculations described in this paper were performed within spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP, version 5.3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> The calculations were based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> The core electrons were described by projector augmented wave potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> and the valence electrons were treated explicitly using plane wave basis sets up to 400 eV of energy.</p><p>The reaction free energies reported in this paper were computed as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Δ = - + G G G RT Q ln( ) p r with ∏ ∏ = - = + + = μ μ | | | | | | | G H TS H E W T Q p p ZPE ( ) / p r p r p r p r p r p r p r p r</formula><p>Here, ΔG is the reaction free energy, p and r in the subscript refer to products and reactants, respectively, H is the enthalpy, which includes the DFT electronic energy E and the zero point energy (ZPE), and S is entropy. The temperature-dependent enthalpy W(T) is simply RT for molecules and Σ q ν ℏω(q ν )/ (exp(ℏω(q ν )/k B T) -1) for solids where q is wave vector, ν is phonon mode index, and ω is the phonon frequency. Q is the reaction quotient, which measures the relative amounts of product and reactant molecules participating in the reaction, and μ is the stoichiometric coefficient for the reaction. The quantities H and S for bulk and surface models were obtained from phonon frequencies using the Phonopy code. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> Accurate force constants are a prerequisite for this, and they were obtained from density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations in VASP using a strict energy convergence threshold of 1.0e -8 eV.</p><p>The Journal of Physical Chemistry C "Natarajan-Elliott" analysis was used to study the competition between CVE and SL reactions via free energies from a modest number of DFT calculations. In this analysis, each precursor pulse is designated to one of four possible cases depending on the reaction free energies of the SL and CVE reactions (negative free energy means the reaction is favorable): <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (a) preferred self-limiting (ΔG CVE , ΔG SL &lt; 0; ΔG SL &lt; ΔG CVE ), (b) purely self-limiting (ΔG CVE &gt; 0; ΔG SL &lt; 0; ΔG SL &lt; ΔG CVE ), (c) preferred etching (ΔG CVE , ΔG SL &lt; 0; ΔG SL &gt; ΔG CVE ), and (d) purely etching (ΔG CVE &lt; 0; ΔG SL &gt; 0; ΔG SL &gt; ΔG CVE ). The bulk and surface models of TiO 2 in the calculations were constructed from its rutile crystalline phase (space group P42/mnm), and the corresponding relaxed geometries are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The bulk unit cell consists of two TiO 2 units, which are optimized by simultaneously relaxing the ionic positions, cell volume and cell shape with a higher energy cutoff of 550 eV and a Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of 6 × 6 × 6. For the surface calculations, a 15 Å thick slab of (2 × 4) supercell of the rutile-TiO 2 (110) surface (Ti 80 O 160 ) with a surface area of 1.57 nm 2 and relaxed surface energy of 0.91 J/ m 2 was constructed with 15 Å of vacuum separating the periodic images in the surface normal direction. This supercell consists of 5 Ti 16 O 32 layers, out of which the bottom two layers were kept fixed. A k-point mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 was used for geometry optimization of this slab. The (110) surface of rutile TiO 2 was chosen for this study as its signature was found from the XRD spectra of TiO 2 ALD at high film thicknesses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> To model the surface geometries resulting from the SL reactions, preserving stoichiometry, 8 surface O atoms are removed from the bare surface of TiO 2 (110) followed by the adsorption of 16 F atoms as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>. Moreover, to represent the reduced TiO 2-x surface, just 12 F atoms are adsorbed following the removal of 8 O atoms as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. For these surface slabs, H and S are computed by considering only the top layer of surface atoms highlighted in the figures.</p><p>Gas phase calculations of the reagent molecules and byproducts were performed using VASP with a large periodic box of dimensions 15.0 Å × 16.0 Å × 15.5 Å with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. However, for convenience, H and S values for these gas phase molecules are obtained from the "freeh" program of the Turbomole suite 36 at a constant pressure of 1 atm. All gas phase calculations in Turbomole were performed with the PBE functional and a valence triple-ζ basis set (def-TZVPP).</p><p>II.B. Experimental Methods. For the FTIR studies of etching, TiO 2 ALD films were first deposited on silicon nanopowder covered with native oxide (&gt;98% US Research Nanomaterials) that had an approximate diameter of 30 nm. This nanopowder was used to achieve a high TiO 2 surface area for greater signal-to-noise for the FTIR experiments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> The powder was pressed into a 1.5 cm × 3 cm tungsten grid that was 50 μm thick with 100 grid lines per inch. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> The tungsten grid was resistively heated with a DC power supply (6268B, 12 V/40 A, HP) to heat to the temperatures needed for the ALD and spontaneous etching experiments. The power supply was controlled by a PID temperature controller (Love Controls  The Journal of Physical Chemistry C 16B, Dwyer Instruments). To monitor the temperature, a type K thermocouple was connected to the tungsten grid with a non conductive epoxy (Cermabond 571).</p><p>TiO 2 ALD was performed in a home-built warm-walled ALD reactor equipped for FTIR studies as described previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> For sample temperatures greater than 150 °C, the chamber walls were held at 150 °C and the sample was heated using the DC power supply. For sample temperatures below 150 °C, the temperature of the chamber walls controlled the sample temperature. TiO 2 ALD was accomplished with sequential exposures of TiCl 4 (≥99.995% trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich) and H 2 O at 200 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> The TiCl 4 and H 2 O reactants produce a TiO 2 ALD growth rate of ≈0.4 Å/cycle at 200 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> The resulting TiO 2 ALD films are amorphous by X-ray diffraction analysis and known to have low chlorine concentrations of ≈1 at% by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> During the TiO 2 ALD process, the TiCl 4 half-cycle was a 2 s exposure at 50-100 mTorr in viscous flow with the N 2 carrier gas. The TiCl 4 exposure was followed by purging with the N 2 carrier gas for 90 s. Then the FTIR spectrum was acquired during a scan for 60 s. The H 2 O half-cycle consisted of a 1 s exposure at 50-80 mTorr in viscous flow with the N 2 carrier gas. The H 2 O exposure was followed by purging with the N 2 carrier gas for 60 s. Then the FTIR spectrum was acquired during a scan for 60 s.</p><p>For HF exposures on TiO 2 , each HF exposure was a 2 s exposure at 200 mTorr in viscous flow with the N 2 carrier gas. The HF exposure was followed by purging with the N 2 carrier gas for 90 s. Then the FTIR spectrum was acquired during a scan for 60 s. Longer purges than necessary for ALD were used to reduce the possibility of HF contact with the KBr windows during the FTIR scan. Spectra were recorded with a spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 . Prior to the etching experiments at different temperatures, the sample was equilibrated at each temperature for 30 min.</p><p>The QMS investigations employed a new reactor that has been described earlier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> This reactor allows the study of etch products produced by flowing reactant gases through powder samples. The etch products and background gas are then expanded through an aperture and form a molecular beam. The beam of background gas and etch products are then passed through a skimmer and enter a differentially pumped region for QMS analysis. The details of this apparatus have been given previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> The skimmer aperture diameter was 1.4 mm, and the skimmer was positioned 41 mm from the sample aperture. The volatile etch products were observed using a high sensitivity, high mass quadrupole mass spectrometer (Extrel, MAX-QMS Flanged Mounted System). Each spectrum was recorded in 1 s and monitored mass intensities from 1 to 500 amu. After the position of the products was determined, the mass spectrum was recorded from 30 to 300 amu using optimized ionization energy and electron multiplier gain. An average of 100 scans were recorded during HF exposures to eliminate noise. Electron-impact ionization of gas-phase etching products was achieved with a circular thoriated iridium filament in the ionization volume inside the ionizer housing. An electron ionization energy of 70 eV was used for these experiments.</p><p>HF was first introduced into a reservoir at a pressure of 9 Torr to have a consistent HF partial pressure during the reaction. HF was leaked into the flowing N 2 background gas. The HF pressure in the sample holder containing the TiO 2 powder was 5.2 Torr. The background N 2 pressure was 2.8 Torr. TiO 2 nanopowder was purchased from US Research Nanomaterials (99.9%, 165 nm diameter) and added to a sample holder. The mass of the TiO 2 nanopowder was recorded before and after the etching experiments. The mass of the nano powder before etching was 40.58 mg.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III.</head><p>A. Computational Results. III.A.1. Computed Energetics of HF Reactions with TiO 2 . The possible CVE and SL reactions representing the HF pulse on TiO 2 are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> along with their corresponding reaction energies computed with DFT. Three sets of CVE and SL reactions are postulated for the TiO 2 and HF interaction. In the CVE1 reaction of TiO 2 , four HF molecules are needed to etch away one unit of bulk as TiF 4 and H 2 O, whereas in the CVE2 reaction, two HF molecules are assumed to be enough to etch a unit of TiO 2 by forming TiOF 2 and H 2 O. These two reactions are of nonredox type since the Ti ion in the product species retains the oxidation state of +4. On the other hand, in the CVE3 reaction, the Ti 4+ ion in TiO 2 is reduced to Ti 3+ by forming TiF 3 . The CVE2 and CVE3 reactions are computed to be unfavorable at 0 K with positive reaction energies while the CVE1 reaction is exoergic.</p><p>Surface-limited versions of these three reactions are also postulated. The SL1, SL2, and SL3 reactions of TiO 2 are found to be energetically more favorable than the CVE1, CVE2, and CVE3 reactions, respectively. This behavior can be interpreted as the TiF units bonded on the surface being much more favorable than TiF x molecules in the gas phase at 0 K. CVE1 and SL1 are the most favorable reactions for TiO 2 since the minimum thermodynamic barriers (differences between CVE and SL reaction energies) of the other reaction sets are significantly larger. Therefore, the energy profile of the HF pulse at T = 0 K falls under the "preferred self-limiting" category as both SL and CVE are energetically allowed, but with CVE facing a minimum thermodynamic barrier of 1.1 eV/ TiO 2 .  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> are computed with a reactant pressure of 0.2 Torr and product pressure of 0.01 Torr in the temperature range 0 to 1000 K. The various contributions to the free energy of the CVE1 reaction of TiO 2 are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. ΔE and ΔZPE do not change with temperature and are represented as horizontal lines. The entropy term, TΔS, dominates the FEP of this reaction by spanning from 0 eV at 0 K to -0.73 eV per bulk unit at 1000 K. The entropy decreases primarily because four gaseous molecules react to produce only three product molecules, which indicates that the relative entropies of reactant and product gases play a crucial role in the temperature-dependence of the etch process. The RT ln(Q) and ΔW terms contribute relatively little in magnitude compared with the entropy term at this pressure. However, these terms do have the effect of offsetting some of the entropic increase in free energy at high temperature for CVE1. At these reactant and product pressures, the FEP shows that the CVE1 reaction is exergonic (ΔG &lt; 0) up to at least 1000 K.</p><p>The FEPs of CVE and SL reactions for TiO 2 can be compared as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The CVE2 and CVE3 reactions have almost identical FEPs and are endergonic even though their FEPs have a negative slope. In contrast, the CVE1 reaction is fully exergonic even though its FEP has a slightly positive slope. At some very high temperature, the ΔG profiles of CVE1 and CVE2 may cross over each other. In that case, CVE2 producing TiOF 2 would become the most favorable etch reaction. However, judging from the slopes of their FEPs, CVE2 and CVE3 will not cross each other. Consequently, the formation of volatile TiF 3 will never be more favorable than the formation of volatile TiOF 2 .</p><p>The SL reactions are comparatively more exoergic than the CVE counterparts at low temperatures up to 360 K (87 °C). The HF molecules passivate the TiO 2 surface and form surface-bound products in the SL reactions. As a result, there is a significant entropic penalty that is evident in the strongly positive slope of the FEPs of the SL reactions. The SL3 reaction is unfavorable at all temperatures above 70 K, which indicates that reduction by HF of surface Ti atoms to TiO 2-x is unlikely.</p><p>Considering only the most favorable reactions, CVE1 and SL1, the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> can be divided into three regions.</p><p>The FEPs of the CVE1 and SL1 reactions cross at 360 K (87 °C). The region between 0 and 360 K is labeled as "preferred self-limiting", since the SL1 reaction is the most favorable in this region and the 'minimum thermodynamic barrier' for SL1 to CVE1 is positive. HF etching of the bulk by CVE1 is possible in this region if the energetic barrier, including kinetic requirement, can be overcome at the reactor conditions. The "minimum thermodynamic barrier" drops from a value of 1.1 eV per bulk unit at 0 K to zero at 360 K where the CVE1 and SL1 reactions become equally favorable for producing byproducts at pressure of 0.01 Torr.</p><p>The region between 360 K (87 °C) and 700 K (427 °C) is called "preferred etching", since fluorination of the surface by reaction SL1 is possible, but the CVE1 reaction to volatile TiF 4 is more favored. The actual etch pathway may face kinetic barriers that have not been computed in this study. While   The Journal of Physical Chemistry C computing the entire mechanism and associated kinetics would always be the ideal approach, resource limitations may not allow it. The SL1 reaction becomes endergonic beyond 700 K, and this temperature region is labeled "purely etching". This label suggests that, at these high temperatures, the surface may resist fluorination via SL1, which may constitute a barrier toward the formation of volatile TiF 4 (for CVE1), though we have no data on such details of the mechanism. III.A.3. Influence of Reactant and Product Pressures. The etch reactions have been considered above at a constant reactant (HF) pressure of 0.2 Torr and a byproduct pressure of 0.01 Torr. The reactant gas pressure can be controlled in the reactor. However, the product pressure is not an experimentally adjustable parameter. Any change in the reactant and product pressures will alter the slope of the FEPs due to the contributions from the RT ln(Q) term, and will hence change the process window. This is now shown for the CVE1 and SL1 reactions of TiO 2 under changes in reactant (HF) pressure from 0.01 to 4 Torr at a constant byproduct pressure of 0.01 Torr.</p><p>Parts a and b of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> display color maps showing the free energy changes of the CVE1 and SL1 reactions of TiO 2 along with the minimum thermodynamic barrier for etching (CVE1-SL1) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>. The CVE1 reaction shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref> is mostly favorable in the entire reactant pressure range. CVE1 also becomes more favorable at high temperatures and high reactant pressure. Consequently, an increase of the reactant pressure decreases the slope of the FEP of the CVE1 reaction. In the SL1 reaction shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>, the favorable region is pushed to higher temperatures at higher reactant pressure.</p><p>From the minimum thermodynamic barrier map in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>, the SL1 reaction is computed to be preferred up to 360 K (87 °C) for the entire reactant pressure range. This means that the temperature at which the FEPs of the CVE1 and SL1 reactions cross over is constant with respect to increase in the reactant pressure, under the assumption of a constant product pressure. This behavior occurs because the number of reactant HF molecules per unit TiO 2 is the same for both CVE1 and SL1 reactions. In the "purely etching" region (ΔG(SL1) &gt; 0 and ΔG(CVE1) &lt; 0), the minimum thermodynamic barrier to etch decreases at higher reactant pressure.</p><p>III.B. Experimental Results. III.B.1. FTIR Spectroscopy. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the progressive growth of a TiO 2 film during 36 ALD cycles on silicon nanoparticles measured by the infrared absorbance. TiCl 4 and H 2 O were employed as the reactants at 200 °C for TiO 2 ALD. The spectra are referenced to the original silicon nanoparticle sample that has a thin native oxide of the silicon surface. The absorption peak at 400-960 cm -1 corresponds to Ti-O stretching vibrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> The Ti-O stretching vibrations yield a peak at 722 cm -1 that increases linearly with number of TiCl 4 and H 2 O cycles.</p><p>The initial cycles of TiO 2 ALD also give rise to several other absorption peaks at 1209, 1048, and 940 cm -1 . The vibrational band at 1209 cm -1 is assigned to Si-O vibrations that arise due to the oxidation of the silicon powder with H 2 O exposures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> This peak grows rapidly during the first 10 TiO 2 ALD cycles, and then the growth slows at higher TiO 2 ALD film thicknesses.

Another TiO 2 ALD film was grown using multiple TiO 2 ALD cycles.  The Journal of Physical Chemistry C</p><note type="other">Figure 8</note><p>shows the difference spectrum after the first exposure of HF at 200 mTorr for 2 s at 280 °C. This difference spectrum is referenced to the infrared spectrum from the last 20 cycles used to grow the TiO 2 ALD film. The vertical axis for this reference spectrum has been scaled and shown in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The comparison between the difference spectrum and the reference spectrum reveals that the HF exposure removes the TiO 2 ALD film. The difference spectrum displays a broad decrease in absorbance at 400-960 cm -1 that is consistent with the spectrum for the TiO 2 ALD film.</p><p>There is also a new feature in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> that is not in agreement with the loss of the absorbance from the Ti-O stretching vibration. This feature is observed as an absorption peak at 777 cm -1 . This absorption feature is assigned to a Ti-F stretching vibration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> The difference spectrum is consistent with the HF exposure spontaneously etching TiO 2 and leaving the TiO 2 surface terminated with Ti-F species after the HF exposure. This Ti-F surface species may be viewed as an intermediate on the way to volatile etch species. The expected possible volatile etch products from the spontaneous etching of TiO 2 by HF may be TiF 4 or TiOF 2 , which is checked by QMS measurements and DFT calculations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows the difference spectra after 10 HF exposures at 200 mTorr for 2 s at 280 °C. The starting sample was a TiO 2 ALD film deposited after 60 ALD cycles. The difference spectra are referenced to the absorption spectrum for this TiO 2 ALD film. The decrease of the absorbance for the Ti-O stretching vibration between 500 and 900 cm -1 in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> is linear with respect to the HF exposure. The continuous loss of TiO 2 indicates spontaneous etching (CVE) during each HF exposure.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> also provides confirmation that the absorption feature at 777 cm -1 corresponds to a Ti-F surface species. This absorption peak at 777 cm -1 persists through the first, third, fifth, and 10th HF exposures. The size of this absorption feature also remains constant during the ten HF exposures. These results are expected since the surface area of Ti-F surface species stays constant as the TiO 2 ALD film is progressively removed by spontaneous etching.</p><p>The spontaneous etching of TiO 2 increases at higher substrate temperature. To quantify the spontaneous etching rate, experiments were performed at 14 different temperatures between 80 and 300 °C. The change in FTIR absorbance was integrated over the frequency range 400 to 960 cm -1 after each HF exposure for 10 HF exposures at each temperature. This change in the integrated absorbance during each HF exposure is proportional to the TiO 2 etch rate, which is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>. There is a small but measurable integrated absorbance loss at temperatures as low as 80 °C (353 K), but not at lower temperatures. The TiO 2 etching starts to increase more noticeably at approximately 150 °C (423 K). The etch rate increases progressively with temperature up to 300 °C (573 K). These results for the spontaneous etching of TiO 2 are in agreement with previous experiments that revealed the Figure 9. FTIR difference spectra after 10 sequential HF exposures at 280 °C on TiO 2 ALD films. Absorbance feature at 777 cm -1 is assigned to Ti-F stretching vibration. The Journal of Physical Chemistry C spontaneous etching of TiO 2 ALD films by HF exposures at 200, 250, and 300 °C using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> A central question in this paper is whether this temperature window for etching can be predicted computationally.</p><p>The change in the integrated absorbance during each HF exposure can also be related to the thickness of the TiO 2 ALD film. From the results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, an integrated absorbance (units of absorbance × cm -1 ) of 118 cm -1 is obtained from 400 to 960 cm -1 after 36 TiO 2 ALD cycles at 200 °C. Previous TiO 2 ALD studies have measured a TiO 2 ALD growth rate of 0.4 Å/cycle using TiCl 4 and H 2 O as the reactants at 200 °C. Using this growth rate, the integrated absorbance of 118 cm -1 after 36 TiO 2 ALD cycles can be equated to a TiO 2 ALD film thickness of 14.4 Å. Using this correlation between integrated absorbance and TiO 2 film thickness, the TiO 2 film thickness removed for the HF exposure of 200 mTorr for 2 s at 300 °C is to be 0.5 Å. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> shows the Arrhenius plot of the temperaturedependent etch rates. This plot of the logarithm of the etch rate versus 1/T is approximately linear. The slope of the Arrhenius plot yields an activation energy of E a = 42 kJ/mol. This activation energy is presumably associated with the kinetics of the rate-limiting mechanistic step during HF etching of TiO 2 .</p><p>III.B.2. QMS Spectrometry. Quadrupole mass spectroscopy was used to investigate the volatile etch species produced when HF interacts with TiO 2 at 300 °C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12a</ref> shows the mass spectrum from 46 to 110 amu that reveals the peaks for TiF 3 + , TiF 2 + , TiF + , and Ti + . The TiF 3 + fragments have the highest intensity. The main fragment for TiF 3 + is at m/z = 105 amu. These titanium fluoride species are assigned to the cracking fragments of TiF 4 + . The small peaks found at 55 and 57 amu correspond to hydrocarbons that are often observed during heating of the filament for electron impact ionization. + fragment can be confirmed by the Ti isotopic ratios. Due to the isotopes of titanium, there should be expected peaks at 103, 104, 105, 106, and 107 amu with intensities of 10.8%, 9.9%, 100%, 7.5%, and 7.3%, respectively. These expectations accurately match the intensities of the peaks observed for the TiF 3 + fragment. TiF 3 + could be a fragment of TiF 4 + . However, TiF 4 + was not observed in the mass spectrum. TiF 4 is consistent with the CVE1 reaction where the expected product is TiF 4(g) . There also could be small contributions from the CVE3 reaction if the product was TiF 3(g) . TiF 3 is not likely as the parent because TiF 3 is a solid with a very high melting point of 1200 °C. In contrast, TiF 4 has a much lower melting point of 377 °C.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref> shows the intensity of the TiF x fragments during the HF exposure with a duration of 2 min. All TiF x fragments rise and fall with the HF exposure. The intensity of the TiF + peak has a higher background intensity resulting from small hydrocarbons desorbing from the filament at 86 amu. All the TiF x + fragments are attributed to TiF 4 . The absence of the TiF 4 parent may result from its fragmentation during   The Journal of Physical Chemistry C ionization. Attempts to observe the TiF 4 parent were unsuccessful even when heating TiF 4 powder in a separate vacuum chamber equipped with a mass spectrometer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14a</ref> shows the increase in the H 2 O + intensity at 18 amu, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14b</ref> shows the increase in the HF + intensity at 20 amu during the HF exposure with a duration of 2 min. The H 2 O + signal rises and falls with the HF exposure. H 2 O is an expected product of both the CVE1 and CVE3 reactions where TiF 4(g) and TiF 3(g) are the respective products. The mass signal for O 2 at 32 amu did not have an increase during the HF exposure. After the etching experiments, the mass of the powder was measured to investigate the mass decrease resulting from etching. The final mass was 31.26 mg compared with 40.58 mg before etching. The etching resulted in a 23% decrease in the mass of the TiO 2 nanopowder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION</head><p>The FEPs of postulated SL and CVE reactions for HF exposure on TiO 2 were calculated over wide temperature and pressure ranges of interest. Experimental results were also obtained for the etch onset, etch rate versus temperature and etch products. The onset temperature was the first temperature where the change in the integrated FTIR absorbance of the Ti-O vibrational band was found to be non-negligible. The FTIR measurements showed that the spontaneous etch of TiO 2 (a CVE-type reaction) was favorable from an onset temperature of 80-90 °C, which agrees with the theoretical prediction that the continuous etching of TiO 2 by reaction CVE1 dominates at temperatures greater than 360 K (87 °C). In this case, the predicted onset temperature is based on crossover of the computed thermodynamics of the candidate etching reactions. The correlation between the experimental and theoretical onset temperature counters the common assumption that onset temperatures are exclusively a reflection of reaction kinetics. Whether this is a general finding remains to be seen in the future.</p><p>The calculations show that the surface remains completely passivated with Ti-F species due to the self-limiting SL1 reaction at temperatures below the onset temperature. The FTIR difference spectra in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> also show a persistent Ti-F signal and the loss of Ti-O signal after each HF pulse on the TiO 2 surface at 280 °C (553 K). At this temperature, the HF pulse is predicted to be in the "preferred etching" state where both SL1 and CVE1 reactions are favorable and compete with each other, but with CVE1 more thermochemically favorable. The favorability of CVE1 explains why spontaneous etching and loss of Ti-O signal is observed in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The Ti-F signal at the surface is observed because the FTIR measurement takes place after the HF exposure. The F-covered TiO 2 surface from the SL1 reaction is preserved because Ti-F is a favorable surface intermediate at this temperature.</p><p>The mass spectrometry measurements identify TiF 4 and H 2 O as the volatile etch products during HF exposure on TiO 2 . These volatile etch products are consistent with the reaction products of the CVE1 reaction pathway that is computed to be favorable, i.e., TiO 2 + 4HF → TiF 4 + 2H 2 O. There were no observed TiOF 2 products in agreement with a thermodynamically unfavorable CVE2 reaction. There was also no detection of an O 2 etch product in agreement with the thermodynamically unfavorable SL3 pathway.</p><p>This computational model generates thermodynamic information from a few DFT calculations on relatively small systems (i.e., bulk crystal, gas-phase molecules, and idealized surface slabs), which makes the model suitable for screening large numbers of candidate chemistries and designing new ALE processes. To look at the mechanism and kinetics underlying the process would require more time-consuming calculations. We expect that such calculations would show which individual steps in the CVE1 reaction are responsible for the measured activation energy (E a = 42 kJ/mol, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>). This activation energy may be the barrier for diffusion of Ti and O atoms from subsurface layers to the fluorinated surface, prior to desorption as TiF 4 and H 2 O respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>A combined computational and experimental approach has been presented to understand the competition between selflimiting and continuous etch reactions in an ALE process using HF exposures on TiO 2 as an example. In situ FTIR spectroscopy was used to study etch rates and surface species during the etching of TiO 2 with HF exposure. In situ mass spectrometry was also employed to identify the volatile etch products. The HF exposure was predicted to continuously etch TiO 2 in the temperature window 360-770 K (87-497 °C). There was excellent agreement between the onset temperature for the TiO 2 spontaneous etching of 87 °C calculated by the simulations and threshold for absorbance change at 80-90 °C measured by FTIR spectroscopy. The calculations also determined that an increase in the reactant pressure did not alter the etching onset temperature of the preferred etching pathway.</p><p>HF was predicted to passivate the TiO 2 surface with Ti-F species in a self-limiting reaction at temperatures up to 360 K (87 °C), and FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Ti-F surface species after HF exposures. The calculations predicted that TiO 2 was more favorably etched as TiF 4 rather than TiF 3 or TiOF 2 , and this was confirmed by the observation of cracking fragments of TiF 4 in mass spectrometry.</p><p>This study illustrates that the competition between selflimiting and continuous reactions can be predicted with straightforward DFT calculations and used to determine the temperature window for ALE processes. In addition, theory can predict the expected volatile etch products and surface species resulting from the self-limiting reactions. This The Journal of Physical Chemistry C theoretical approach has also been experimentally validated using HF exposures on TiO 2 . These theoretical predictions can therefore guide experiments so as to more efficiently develop viable ALE processes. This method of understanding the competition between self-limiting and continuous reactions should be useful for rapid high-throughput screening of precursors and various substrates to design new thermal ALE processes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
