It involves a plasma activation step and a thermal step where etchant molecules remove a fraction of the surface. To accelerate process development, a computational model for the thermodynamics of the thermal removal step is highly desirable. An energy expression is developed here to calculate the removal step energy for an activated slab structure. The approach samples the configurations of the activated metal surfaces and determines the thermodynamic balance of the removal step for each obtained configuration. The heterogeneity of the surface terminations is treated by the equilibrium crystal shape method. The models are put to test with combinations of two modifiers (O and N), two substrates (Cu "

For the ultimate control of the composition and structure of surfaces, selective and accurate engineering methods at the nanometer/subnanometer scale are required. Whereas atomic layer deposition (ALD) enables the atomistic control of material addition, the reverse process of atomic layer etching (ALE) is not yet incorporated into mainstream industrial processes as it was considered too slow to be practical. However, continued feature- size scaling has made it apparent that for certain applications, precision rather than throughput is the bottleneck. Existing plasma etching techniques are fundamentally unable to fulfill this role as they all rely on inert ions as an energy source to some extent, yielding a poorly selective process with little control in thickness."

During the activation step, the top atomic layer(s) of the pristine surface are converted to another compound by the modifiers. The activation is limited by the surface compound formed, which blocks further reaction once all pristine surface atoms/sites are consumed/occupied. Next, during the removal step, etchant molecules are introduced that remove the surface compound. The removal stops as soon as the surface compound is consumed since the etchant molecules are selected such that they cannot etch the pristine surface. The cycle is repeated until the desired etch thickness is achieved. While the abstract "

This, in turn, necessitates new metal patterning techniques. Etching of metals is conventionally done in the solution phase by harsh chemicals. The random motion of etchant molecules implies that this process is inherently isotropic. To create an anisotropic process, modern patterning techniques exploit the directionality of ions in the plasma sheath. While plasma etching has been applied successfully to silicon- based materials, its application on metals is problematic since the metal species leaves the surface in the form of unstable, high- energy compounds that readily redeposit on the chamber walls and other parts of the wafer."

The removal step (Figure 1D- 1F) is done with organic etchants that react with the surface oxide to form volatile complexes and water, eliminating the need for an extra energy source and avoiding redeposition. This new process, termed plasma- thermal ALE, is conceptually very similar to the thermal ALE process developed by George and co- workers. The main difference of plasma- thermal ALE lies in the activation step, where the oxidizing reagent is excited via a low- temperature plasma. Plasma imparts directionality to the process, enabling an anisotropic etching profile."

Existing studies center on a single process, using combinations of experimental and computational tools to propose a mechanism. These allow for the classification of existing ALE processes, and the rationalization can be generalized to other substrates, modifiers, and etchants to discover new processes. However, difficulties of in situ characterization of the surface and the low pressures of the products formed prevent direct confirmation of these mechanisms. These challenges also mean that the mechanisms lack atomistic detail, limiting their usefulness in understanding the chemistry and conditions that lead to a successful metal ALE process. For this purpose, a computational thermodynamic model of ALE is necessary."

The layer model energy expression, the core of the model, allows the calculation of the removal step energy change from quantum chemical calculations on a slab structure. The activated surfaces, after interaction with the modifiers, are sampled with adsorption configuration search by the \"greedy\" algorithm. The etching products are determined computationally using literature data as input structures when available. The removal step energies on different terminations are combined via a weighted sum, with weights obtained via the equilibrium crystal shape construction. The combined approach results in a single- valued prediction for the removal step energies, based on the postplasma surface structure, modifier, and etchant. The model thus links the postactivation surface morphology to the removal step thermodynamics. We propose that this removal step energy can be used to evaluate and screen potential plasma- thermal atomic layer etching processes."

While we do not expect kinetic barriers to be significant in the activation step, in the removal step, the formation of the hydride and desorption of the formed complex might be activated. Existing data suggests that the desorption of the metal- organic complex is the limiting step and often high temperature is required to overcome the barrier. It is likely, however, that the magnitude of such barriers will depend to a significant extent on the surface morphology. The postplasma surface morphology is far from clear at this point, and we do not claim that the surface structure used here corresponds to the postplasma surface. In other words, the effect of kinetic energy of the ion is a missing link, deferred to a future study."

For the discussion below, the Ni/O/HFA system is used as our working example.

At every iteration, one adsorbate is added to each available adsorption site, forming a pool of candidate structures for the next round. The adsorption sites themselves are determined by symmetry on the primitive pristine surface unit cell: every unique atom defines a top site, every unique pair of atoms defines a bridge site, etc. The supercell is not varied. Figure S2 gives the supercell used and the adsorption sites. Each candidate is then fully relaxed, and the most stable candidate is selected to enter the next round. Figures S7- S10 give the structures of the selected candidates at every round. The configuration search determines a unique configuration for every termination at discrete coverages. The method adopted here is a static one, the effect of finite temperature is included in the entropy contribution to the free energy obtained via calculation of the surface phonon frequencies. A full computational treatment of the temperature effect on activation, requiring dynamic calculations (e.g., as molecular dynamics simulation of ion impact), is outside our scope."

Plasma diagnostics or simulation of ion energy distributions (IEDs) is not attempted. Instead, the assumption of surface- plasma equilibrium allows us to indirectly determine the chemical potential through the simulated modifier coverage (area density). At the coverage observed (the coverage that self- limited adsorption stops at), no termination should have a positive adsorption energy. The chemical potential of the modifier is thus chosen to be the minimum required to set the adsorption free energy of all terminations greater than or equal to 0, leading to a modifier chemical potential as a function of coverage (eq 10)"

Admittedly, the ECS method is not entirely consistent with our process since it minimizes the total surface energy subject to a fixed grain volume, whereas the surface faceting behavior is limited by a fixed cross- sectional area. Hence, we do not claim that our ECS- based model accurately describes the microfaceting that might occur in response to adsorbate coverage changes. Solving the cross- sectional area- constrained minimization problem is outside the scope of the present work, and the ECS method is adopted as a physics- inspired way to systematically assign the weights. Nor do we claim that microfaceting reconstruction will occur at our target process temperatures. The inspiration came from the transient heat spikes present locally near the ion impact region during the plasma oxidation, which can temporarily bring the local temperature close to the melting point. Nevertheless, the ECS is an ad hoc addition to the model to allow for calculation of single- valued etching energies that can be more readily compared between different proposed ALE processes. Since the per- termination removal step energies are independent of this assumption, when more reliable information on the surface is available (e.g., via the crystal orientation distribution function from X- ray diffraction), the weights can be substituted in"

For the monomer case, three structures (monodentate, bidentate planar, bidentate tetrahedral) are searched and the bidentate planar is found to be the most stable. Our results contradict an earlier study17,39 that suggested tetrahedral being more stable. We confirmed the trend by performing atomic basis set calculations in Gaussian35 (see Section 3). Dimers, trimers, and tetramers of various configurations are built and compared. Three tetramers are built (Figure 2), and only the most stable structures' energies are"

The bonds from the metal center to the ligand atoms are progressively elongated with respect to the nuclearity to accommodate more ligands. The formate and formamidinate complexes follow the same pattern, although the metal- nitrogen bonds in amidinate complexes are slightly longer than the corresponding metal- oxygen bonds in formate complexes, presumably due to steric repulsion among the amine groups. By the Gibbs free energy, the most stable formate complex is the dimer, and the most stable formamidinate complex is the trimer. Since thermodynamics cannot preclude kinetic barriers that may prevent the formation of these large complexes, the main results are recalculated with the monomer complex as the product in Figures S11 and S12."

The surface supercell used is briefly investigated for the (100), (111), and (211) surfaces by considering a few supercells of symmetries different from those used for the configuration search. The results (see Figure S3) indicate that the errors introduced by supercell selection are small. Furthermore, in the event that the configuration search misses some more stable structures at a given coverage, this error does not propagate significantly through the Wulff construction to the final, averaged removal step energy. For structures with extended reconstruction (e.g., missing row (MR) and pairing row (PR) reconstructions on the (110) termination), the adsorption energies are much more favorable than what we have found. Since these structures require the addition or removal of metal atoms, our algorithm cannot recover them. Depending on the size of the crystalline domains on the amorphous or polycrystalline surface, these reconstructed domains may or may not be important. The comparison indicates that our configurations lie close to the global minimum when extended reconstructions are not considered."

As expected, the cohesive energy of the metal clearly plays a significant role. The easier it is to atomize the metal crystal, the more favorable etching would become. The relative strength of metal- modifier, hydrogen- modifier, and hydrogen- hydrogen bonding, as well as the number of bonds broken and formed, also influences the removal step energy outcome. In particular, the redox potential of the metal will clearly play a role in the strength of the metal- modifier bond since this interaction involves a change in the metal oxidation state. Moreover, the difference between hydrogen- modifier bond energy and hydrogen- hydrogen bond energy will affect the selectivity of etching the activated surface to the pristine surface: the stronger hydrogen binds to the modifier compared with another hydrogen atom, the stronger the driving force for the etching reaction on the activated surface, and the more likely the removal step will be self- limited. The free energy of the metal complex is also of the utmost importance. While the most stable structure can be searched in a straightforward manner as is done here, there is little guarantee that the most stable molecule is the actual molecule formed. The case in point is the nickel complexes (Figure 2).

In such cases, the monomer- based thermodynamics could be more relevant to the design of ALE processes."

To achieve the precise atomic layer removal, the activation has to be limited to the top layer.

Alternatively, etching may stop before all of the modifiers are consumed since the low coverage of modifiers left on the surface would lead to unfavorable etching. Thus, the observed etch per cycle can be "

In essence, it is a thermodynamic average of the removal step, whereas, as the etch proceeds, modifier coverage continuously decreases. It is not possible to pinpoint the coverage or activation thickness at which the etching will stop with the present model.

At the ideal level, it uses time- separated steps of self- limited surface reactions to achieve high selectivity, specificity, and anisotropy, at the same time opening up the process to many new, traditionally hard- to- etch materials. The large chemical space of ALE, involving the antecedent choices of substrates, modifiers, etchants, and process parameters, is impossible to exhaust by a trial- and- error approach. In the present work, the thermodynamics of the removal step is proposed as a descriptor for ALE chemistries. A computational framework that attempts to evaluate this descriptor has been developed. Only a minimal input from the experiment is required to keep it as self- contained as possible, but experimental information on the etch product, the distribution of the crystal terminations, and the postplasma surface structure can be readily used to improve the accuracy of the model."

While easy to use, it lacks the flexibility needed to treat the complex surface effects. The layer model is developed to remedy this. Relying on surface adsorption calculations, an approach has been developed to yield a single- valued removal step free- energy change. It is found through the layer model study that the etching tends to become more favorable at higher coverages of modifier atoms. At high coverages, the surface oxides and nitrides are more favorable to etch than the bulk oxides and nitrides. Nitrogen activation results in more favorable etching than oxygen activation on the Cu surfaces, and the two give similar removal step energies on Ni surfaces. Qualitative agreement with the experiment can be obtained by destabilizing the surface via sublayer adsorption structures or stabilizing the products via forming polynuclear metal complexes."
