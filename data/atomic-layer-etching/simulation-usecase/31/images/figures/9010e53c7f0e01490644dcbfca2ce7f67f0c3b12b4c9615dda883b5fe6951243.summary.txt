The chart illustrates the energy per metal atom relative to monomer for different molecular structures (Monomer, Dimer, Trimer, Tetramer) under two conditions (ΔE<sub>FA</sub>, ΔE<sub>FAmd</sub>) and at a specific temperature (80°C). The energy values decrease with increasing molecular size for both conditions, with ΔE<sub>FAmd</sub> showing more pronounced negative values than ΔE<sub>FA</sub>. At 80°C, the trend reverses, with ΔG<sup>80°C</sup><sub>FA</sub> showing a peak at the Trimer and then decreasing, while ΔG<sup>80°C</sup><sub>FAmd</sub> shows a similar pattern but with less pronounced peaks.
