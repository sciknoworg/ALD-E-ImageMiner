| Sample | Energy (eV) | Description |
|---|---|---|
|(a) Initial Sample | - | A uniform arrangement of Si and C atoms forming a crystal lattice. |
|(b) 10 eV CF₂⁺ | - | Similar to initial sample, but with some CF₂⁺ ions interacting with the surface. |
|(c) 20 eV CF₂⁺ | - | Interaction becomes more pronounced, with CF₂⁺ ions partially penetrating the lattice. |
|(d) 30 eV CF₂⁺ | - | Significant penetration of CF₂⁺ ions into the lattice, disrupting the original structure. |
