The line chart illustrates the F density (Atoms/Å³) at different heights (Å) for three conditions: 'Initial sample', '200 Ar⁺ Impacts', and '400 Ar⁺ Impacts'. The chart is divided into two subplots, each corresponding to a different energy level (20 eV and 50 eV). The 'Initial sample' shows a relatively flat distribution, while the '200 Ar⁺ Impacts' and '400 Ar⁺ Impacts' show more pronounced peaks and variations.
