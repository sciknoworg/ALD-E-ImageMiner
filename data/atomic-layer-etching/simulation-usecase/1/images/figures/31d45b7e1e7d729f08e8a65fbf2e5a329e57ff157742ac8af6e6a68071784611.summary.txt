The image displays two 3D molecular structures of silicon carbide (SiC) with fluorine (F) atoms. The top structure has a 20 eV energy level, while the bottom one has a 40 eV energy level. The structures show a layered arrangement with Si and C atoms forming the layers, and F atoms dispersed throughout.
