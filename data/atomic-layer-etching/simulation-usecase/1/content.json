        "text": "A molecular dynamics model is used to understand the layer- by- layer etching of Si and  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  using fluorocarbon and  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ions. In these two- step etch processes, a nanometer- scale fluorocarbon passivation layer is grown on the material's surface using low energy  $\\mathrm{CF}_x^+$  ions or radicals. The top layers of the material are then reactive ion etched by  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ions utilizing the fluorocarbon already present on the material surface. By repeating these two steps, Si or  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  can be etched with nanometer- scale precision and the etch rate is considerably faster than what traditional atomic layer etching techniques provide. The modeling results show that fluorocarbon passivation films can be grown in a self- limiting manner on both Si and  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  using low energy  $\\mathrm{CF}_2^+$  and  $\\mathrm{CF}_3^+$  ions. The fluorocarbon passivation layer is a few angstroms thick, and its thickness increases with the fluorocarbon ion's energy. Increasing the ion energy, however, amorphizes the top atomic layers of the material. In addition, the fluorocarbon film becomes  $\\mathrm{F}$  rich with increasing ion energy. Simulations of fluorocarbon passivated  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  surface show that  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ions with energy below  $50~\\mathrm{eV}$  etch Si (within  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ ) in a self- limiting manner. Si etching stops once  $\\mathrm{F}$  in the fluorocarbon passivation layer is exhausted or is pushed too deep into the substrate. Oxygen within  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  is more easily sputtered from the material surface than Si, and the top layers of  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  are expected to become O deficient during  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion bombardment.  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion etching of fluorocarbon passivated Si also appears to be self- limiting below  $30~\\mathrm{eV}$  ion energy, and etching stops once  $\\mathrm{F}$  on the material surface is either consumed or becomes inaccessible. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

        "text": "Both techniques are pulsed in nature and make use of self- limiting growth processes in which deposition is limited to a few angstroms during each step. During ALD, several such self- limiting deposition processes are alternated to deposit films in a layer- by- layer fashion. In many ALE schemes, following the deposition of a subnanometer thick passivant, the top monolayer or less of the substrate is removed using energetic ions, ultraviolet radiation, or through thermal means. $^{7}$  ALD has found many applications in microelectronics including the deposition of high-  $\\kappa$  gate dielectrics $^{1}$  and metallic diffusion barriers for copper interconnects. $^{2}$  However, ALE is still not widely used, one of the primary hindrances being its extremely slow etch rate. ALE etch rates are slow enough that the use of ALE for the fabrication of microelectronics devices is currently economically impractical. Current plasma etching techniques, on the other hand, do not allow the degree of control necessary for fabricating devices with subnanometer precision. There is therefore a need for etching processes that proceed at a reasonable rate, but allow subnanometer- scale control of film dimensions. One potential solution for such an etch process is to use a pulsed technique similar to ALE but etch several monolayers during each cycle. This can be achieved, for example, through the deposition of nanometer- scale fluorocarbon passivation layers. Previous experimental work has shown that such passivation films can be grown using fluorocarbon plasmas, ions, or radicals. $^{21 - 28}$  Our article attempts to elucidate the details of such pulsed etching processes for Si and  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ . A molecular dynamics (MD) model is used for this purpose, and the model is used to examine both the deposition and etching steps during the layer- by- layer etching of Si and  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ .",

Abrams and Graves32- 35 developed a MD based model for an etch system comprising of Si, C, and F and used this model to investigate Si etching using  $\\mathrm{CF}_x^+$ $(x = 0 - 3)$  ions. Their modeling results indicated that a reactive layer forms on the Si surface, and the structure of this  $\\mathrm{SiC}_x\\mathrm{F}_y$  reactive layer is more complicated than etching with only  $\\mathrm{F}$  or Cl. The thickness of the reactive layer increased with the energy of the bombarding radical. Abrams and Graves characterized etch byproduct distributions as a function of ion energy, looked at the differences between etching due to the different  $\\mathrm{CF}_x^+$ $(x = 0 - 3)$  ions, and attempted to capture their complex MD results in terms of a simple set of mass balance equations.

The complexity of the underlying physical processes makes more thorough validation essential, although it is difficult at present given the scarcity of relevant experimental data that can be used for quantitative comparison.

Results in Fig. 6 include Si and O atoms in all clusters. It is found that, in the presence of  $\\mathrm{F}$  atoms on the surface, Si is initially etched for all  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion energies considered. However, as the concentration of  $\\mathrm{F}$  atoms in the near surface region decreases, the sputtering of Si atoms ceases at  $20\\mathrm{eV}\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion energy. The sputtering of Si atoms stops at  $40\\mathrm{eV}$  as well, although more Si atoms are removed from the surface. At  $50\\mathrm{eV}$ , Si continues to etch even after  $\\mathrm{F}$  concentration at the surface has been reduced although the etch rate decreases. In contrast to Si atoms, O atom ejection from the surface does not stop even up to  $800\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion impacts, the maximum number of ion impacts we have examined. The rate of O loss, however, decreases after the initial stage of  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion bombardment for ion energies below  $40\\mathrm{eV}$ . Each O atom is bound to two Si atoms in a crystalline  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  lattice while Si atoms are attached to four O atoms. As  $\\mathrm{Si - O}$  bond energy is about  $4.2\\mathrm{eV}$ ,  $\\sim 16.8\\mathrm{eV}$  is needed to liberate a Si atom from the lattice. O atoms, on the other hand, only require  $\\sim 8.4\\mathrm{eV}$  to break free from the lattice. Because of this lower energy requirement, O atoms continue to exit the material at a slow pace even after Si sputtering has ceased. It is expected that the region near the surface will become deficient in O atoms before O etching stops.",

The fluorocarbon passivation layer is a few angstroms, thick, and its thickness increases with the fluorocarbon ion's energy.
