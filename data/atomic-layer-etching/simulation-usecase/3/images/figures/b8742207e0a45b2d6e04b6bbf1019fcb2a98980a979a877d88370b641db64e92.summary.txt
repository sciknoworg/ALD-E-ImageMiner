The bar chart illustrates the etch depth per cycle (ML) for two different processes: Passivation and Ion Bombard. The x-axis represents the aspect ratio (AR) and the gamma ratio (Γ/Γ<sub>c</sub>). The y-axis shows the etch depth per cycle. The chart indicates that the etch depth increases with decreasing AR and Γ/Γ<sub>c</sub>, with Passivation showing slightly higher values than Ion Bombard.
