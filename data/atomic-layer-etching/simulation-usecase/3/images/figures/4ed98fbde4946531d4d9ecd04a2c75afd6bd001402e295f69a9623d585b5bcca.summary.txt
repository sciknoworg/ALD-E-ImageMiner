The bar chart illustrates the etch depth per cycle for Physical (Si) and Chemical (SiCl<sub>x</sub>) processes at different aspect ratios (AR) and dielectric constants (ε<sub>∞</sub>). The etch depth increases with higher AR and ε<sub>∞</sub>, with Physical Si showing slightly higher values than Chemical SiCl<sub>x</sub> across all conditions.
