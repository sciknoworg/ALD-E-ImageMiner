In plasma- ALE process, the etching energy threshold of plasma is a critical parameter that affects ion- bombardment- induced damage, etching efficiency, as well as material selectivity. Although plasma- generated photons were recently reported to help lower the etching energy, fundamental mechanism of the in- plasma photon- assisted ALE process is not fully understood. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) and time- dependent DFT calculations were carried out to give an in- depth fundamental understanding of the role of plasma- generated photons in the ALE process of chlorinated Si(111) surfaces. Calculation results show that the chlorination of targeted Si at atomic layer can effectively reduce the energy barrier for removal/desorption from 6.1832 eV to 2.5159 eV. Under the irradiation of plasma- generated photons, the "

The further extension of Moore's law concerns the requirement of atomic and close- to- atomic scale manufacturing (ACSM) with high throughput [3,4]. As a counterpart of atomic layer deposition (ALD), atomic layer etching (ALE) technique has recently attracted extensive attention because of its potential for realizing controllable manufacturing with atomic- level precision and acceptable throughput [5- 7]. Compared with conventional dry etching techniques, ALE breaks down the conventional continuous and simultaneous dry etching process into two sequential and self- limiting reaction steps: surface modification and selective removal. The surface layer is first modified by specific precursors to weaken the bonds between surface- layer atoms and the underlying bulk atoms, followed by selective removal with plasma or heat. This enables the ALE technique with a higher- level controllability as well as higher etching precision. To date, the advanced ALE technique has been successfully applied to an "
