The chart illustrates the potential energy changes over surface coordinate Z (Ã…) at different time points (t=0, t=5 fs, t=10 fs, t=400 fs). It shows the transition from the excited state to the ground state, with key terms like 'Excitation', 'Quenching', and 'Evolving' indicating the process dynamics.
