Different from most ALE processes using plasma- enhanced or other energetic particles- enhanced surface reactions, thermal ALE realizes isotropic atomic- level etch control based on sequential thermal- drive reaction steps that are self- terminating and self- saturating. Thermal ALE can be viewed as the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD), both of which define the atomic layer removal and growth steps required for advanced semiconductor fabrication. In this review, we focus on the concept and basic characteristics of the thermal ALE in comparison with ALD. Several typical thermal ALE mechanisms including fluorination and ligand- exchange, conversion- etch, oxidation and fluorination reactions are intensively introduced. The pros and cons of thermal ALE, plasma ALE, and traditional plasma etching are compared. Some representative materials and their typical thermal ALE processes are summarized. Finally, the outlook and challenges of thermal ALE are addressed."

Unlike the anisotropic plasma ALE, the thermal ALE is etched isotropically by using thermal- drive sequential and self- limiting reactions and can be regarded as the inverse of ALD process [8- 10]. The combination of ALD and ALE can define the atomic layer growth and removal required for advanced semiconductor fabrication, producing ultrasmooth thin films based on deposit/etch- back methods and conformal etching in high- aspect- ratio structures [17]. The etching accuracy reaches atomic- scale dimensions, and a large area of uniform etching surface can be obtained. At the same time, the thermal ALE can also be selectively etched according to the specific radicals or ions process. Because of the above advantages, thermal ALE is triggering tremendous research interests in searching for the most applicable etching materials, processing approach and etching mechanism."

Similar to the concept of layer- by- layer growth of atomic layer deposition (ALD) [8], thermal ALE leads to the layer- by- layer removal of materials [14,18,19]. Fig. 1 shows schematics of one complete thermal ALE and ALD cycle. A typical thermal ALE cycle usually consists of two half- reactions: surface modification (half- reaction A) and surface removal (half- reaction B) in Fig. 1(a). Surface modification A refers to that a surface chemisorption layer is formed on the etched surface via precursor vapor self- limiting adsorption, similar to ALD. Surface removal B is that the surface chemisorption layer is converted to volatile etching "

Correspondingly, there is also the concept of thermal ALE window in atomic layer etching. However, ALD window is not an essential requirement.

In several material systems, thermal ALE has been confirmed to obtain controllable and conformal surface etching with sub- nanometer scale, ultra- smooth surface, no damage in high aspect- ratio structures, and possible anisotropic etching with ion or radical enhancement. As an essential counterpart to ALD, ALE and ALD can enable the atomic layer growth and removal steps for advanced semiconductor fabrication, providing new processing capabilities for constructing three- dimensional nanodevices."

The quality and smoothness of etched surface and subsurface, etching fidelity in high aspect- ratio structures, and high materials selectivity become more and more important. This provides an alternative approach for thermal ALE to find the way in future semiconductor manufacturing processes. Above all, at the tipping point the development of thermal ALE is facing tremendous opportunities and challenges ahead. It is believed that emerging thermal ALE could have promising futures and prospects like ALD through continuous efforts of academia and industry."
