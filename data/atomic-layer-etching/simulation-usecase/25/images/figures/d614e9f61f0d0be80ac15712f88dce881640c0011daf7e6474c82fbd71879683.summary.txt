The chart illustrates the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) with respect to temperature for two different materials, HfO₂ and ZrO₂, under conditions labeled as 'Preferred self-limiting' and 'Purely etching'. Two transition temperatures (T1 and T2) are marked for each material, indicating a shift from one behavior to another.
