| (a) Formation of 1 H₂O on ZrO₂ 12B HF | A single water molecule (H₂O) is adsorbed on a ZrO₂ surface with a specific bond angle of 110.2°. The structure shows the interaction between the water molecule and the surface atoms. |
| (b) Formation of 2 H₂O on ZrO₂ 16A HF | Two water molecules (H₂O) are adsorbed on a ZrO₂ surface with different bond angles of 109.4° and 110.8°. The structure illustrates the arrangement of multiple water molecules interacting with the surface. |
