The chart illustrates the change in energy (ΔE), Gibbs free energy (ΔG), work (ΔW), and total energy plus zero-point energy (ΔE+ΔZPE) as a function of temperature for the reaction SE1: HfO₂(bulk) + 4 HF(g) → HfF₄(g) + 2 H₂O(g). The lines converge at higher temperatures, indicating that the reaction becomes more favorable.
