        "text": "ABSTRACT:  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  are two high-  $k$  materials that are important in the downscaling of semiconductor devices. Atomic- level control of material processing is required for the fabrication of thin films of these materials at nanoscale device sizes. Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of metal oxides, in which up to one monolayer of the material can be removed, can be achieved by sequential self- limiting (SL) fluorination and ligand- exchange reactions at elevated temperatures. However, to date, a detailed atomistic understanding of the mechanism of thermal ALE of these technologically important oxides is lacking. In this paper, we investigate the hydrogen fluoride (HF) pulse in the first step in the thermal ALE process of  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  using first- principles simulations. We introduce Natarajan- Elliott analysis, a thermodynamic methodology, to compare reaction models representing the self- limiting (SL) and continuous spontaneous etching (SE) processes taking place during an ALE pulse. Applying this method to the first HF pulse on  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$ , we found that thermodynamic barriers impeding continuous etching are present at ALE- relevant temperatures. We performed explicit HF adsorption calculations on the oxide surfaces to understand the mechanistic details of the HF pulse. A HF molecule adsorbs dissociatively on both oxides by forming metal- F and  $\\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{H}$  bonds. HF coverages ranging from  $1.0 \\pm 0.3$  to  $17.0 \\pm 0.3 \\mathrm{HF / nm}^2$  are investigated, and a mixture of molecularly and dissociatively adsorbed HF molecules is present at higher coverages. Theoretical etch rates of  $- 0.61 \\pm 0.02 \\mathrm{~A / cycle}$  for  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $- 0.57 \\pm 0.02 \\mathrm{~A / cycle}$  for  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  were calculated using maximum coverages of  $7.0 \\pm 0.3$  and  $6.5 \\pm 0.3 \\mathrm{~M} - \\mathrm{F}$  bonds  $\\mathrm{nm}^2$ , respectively  $(\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{HE}, \\mathrm{Zr})$ .",

As a result of the shrinking of device feature sizes,  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  gate dielectrics would be so thin that electron tunneling through the dielectric layer, which leads to high leakage currents, is impossible to avoid. Materials with high dielectric constant,  $k$ , allow a high drive current to be maintained, while minimized leakage current and a low equivalent oxide thickness can be achieved.  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  are high-  $k$  dielectric materials with dielectric constants of  $22 - 23$ , which are used in semiconductor devices.  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  are also thermodynamically stable when interfaced with silicon in semiconductor applications. However, conformal nanometer- scale feature sizes in high- aspect- ratio structures are difficult to achieve with traditional wet and dry chemical etching methods, which do not permit the level of control required. Recently, atomic layer etching (ALE) has gained significant interest for the controlled etching of thin films, in particular, for nanoelectronic devices. ALE shares many features with atomic layer deposition (ALD) and can be considered as the reverse of ALD. ALE permits the removal of thin films with atomic- scale precision using sequential and self- limiting (SL) surface reactions, similar to ALD.",

The purpose of this modification step is to form a reactive, but nonvolatile, layer that can be easily removed in the subsequent ligand- exchange step.6,33 To date, reactions during thermal ALE are based on gas- phase fluorination that converts the metal- containing film into a layer of the corresponding nonvolatile metal fluoride.4,7,11 For metal oxides, thermal ALE processes generally use HF for the fluorination step.2 HF is a useful nucleophilic fluorination reactant in which the fluoride anion serves as the active reaction species.36 This modification step in thermal ALE is the focus of this paper.",

Self- limiting reactions are a necessary part of thermal ALE and allow the degree of etching to be well controlled and defined.

        "text": "Depending on whether the SL reaction or the SE reaction is the most favorable (based on their  $\\Delta G$  values), the energy profiles in Figure 3 are classified broadly as self- limiting or etching. The energy profile in Figure 3a is termed as \"preferred self- limiting\" since the SL reaction is more thermodynamically favored than the SE reaction, even though both SL and SE reactions are exergonic. Here, there is a possibility of etching if the collective barrier (at least  $Y - X$ ) could be overcome under the reactor conditions. If the energy profile in Figure 3a is shifted along the vertical axis such that the SL reaction is exoergic and the SE reaction is endergonic, we obtain the energy profile in Figure 3b termed as \"purely self- limiting\". This is the ideal energy profile for the surface modification pulse in an ALE process since unlimited etching is energetically unfavorable. The energy profile in Figure 3c is the reverse of that in Figure 3a since the SE reaction is energetically more favorable than the SL reaction ( $Y - X < 0$ ). The collective barrier, if any, for etching would be comparatively lower than in the preferred self- limiting state, and it may be easily breached under the reactor conditions. Therefore, the energy profile in Figure 3c is termed as \"preferred etching\". Figure 3d is obtained by shifting the energy profile in Figure 3c such that the SL reaction is endergonic and the SE reaction is exergonic. This profile is termed as \"purely etching\" since the precursor molecules should readily volatilize the surface atoms and proceed to the subsurface region to cause bulk etching without significant barriers. This is the ideal energy profile for a SE pulse. Thus, the shape of the energy profile at any given temperature and pressure will allow us to predict the net effect of the precursor- substrate interaction. We refer to this computational approach as the N- E analysis.",

The  $\\mathrm{Hf} - \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{Zr} - \\mathrm{F}$ , and  $\\mathrm{O} - \\mathrm{H}$  bond lengths are shown for each adsorption mode in Figure 8. The surface  $\\mathrm{O}$  atoms are either 2- fold or 3- fold coordinated by surface  $\\mathrm{Hf / Zr}$  atoms on both surfaces. All of the surface  $\\mathrm{Hf / Zr}$  atoms are 6- fold coordinated by  $\\mathrm{O}$  atoms. Since the structures of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  are similar, the strongest adsorption mode (one HF B for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2} - 1.95 \\mathrm{eV}$  and for  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2} - 1.74 \\mathrm{eV}$ ) involves the same 6- fold coordinated metal lattice site and 2- fold coordinated surface oxygen site.",

Therefore, we suggest that the first precursor pulse using  $\\mathrm{HF}_i$  at these conditions, will produce a stable and nonvolatile layer of metal fluorides and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  as byproducts. We also found that at elevated temperatures, the formation of the volatile metal fluoride is more favorable than the formation of the volatile metal oxyfluoride. The self- limiting nature of the fluorination reaction is due to the formation of a passivated layer during HF exposure.26 The HfFx layer formed on  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  after fluorination is self- limiting because this surface layer forms a diffusion barrier to subsequent fluorination by HF.11 Multiple coverages of HF molecules starting from  $1.0\\pm 0.3$  to  $17.0\\pm$ $0.3\\mathrm{HF / nm}^2$  resulted in mixed dissociated and molecular adsorption of HF to the surfaces of  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  .We found maximal coverages of  $(6.0\\pm 0.3) - (7.0\\pm 0.3)$  metal  $- \\mathrm{F / nm}^2$  at higher HF coverages.

Both  $(2\\times 2)$  supercells of monoclinic (111)  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  have surface areas of 1.98  $\\mathrm{nm}^2$  with 16 metal atoms on the surface that can form metal- F bonds that correspond to coverages of  $8.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{Hf / nm}^2$  and  $8.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{Zr / nm}^2$  respectively. As the maximum coverage of  $\\mathrm{Hf - F}$  is  $7.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{F / nm}^2$  there will be approximately  $0.88\\mathrm{F}$  atoms per surface Hf. The maximum coverage of  $\\mathrm{Zr - F}$  is  $6.5\\pm$ $0.3\\mathrm{F / nm}^2$  so there will be approximately  $0.81\\mathrm{F}$  atoms per surface  $\\mathrm{Zr}$  The SE1 reactions showed that four F atoms lead to the etching of one  $\\mathrm{Hf / Zr}$  atom as volatile metal tetrafluoride. Similar to the analysis done by Kondati Natarajan et al,39 the coverage of  $\\mathrm{Hf / Zr}$  that can be etched is one- quarter of the  $\\mathrm{M - }$  F coverage  $(\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{Hf},\\mathrm{Zr})$ $1.8\\pm 0.1\\mathrm{Hf / (nm}^2$  cycle) for  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $1.6\\pm 0.1\\mathrm{Zr / (nm}^2$  cycle) for  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  .As the surface concentration of metal atoms is  $8.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{Hf}$  or  $\\mathrm{Zr / nm}^2$  this etch rate corresponds to 0.2 monolayer cycle. For  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2,$  this corresponds to  $- 61.2\\pm 0.8\\mathrm{ng / (cm}^2$  cycle) and using the mass density of bulk  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ $(10.0\\mathrm{g / cm}^3)$ $- 0.61\\pm 0.02\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$  .For  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2,$  this corresponds to  $- 33.3\\pm 0.8\\mathrm{ng / (cm}^2$  cycle) and using the mass density of bulk  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$ $(3.9\\mathrm{g / cm}^3)$ $- 0.57\\pm 0.02$ $\\dot{\\mathrm{A}} /$  cycle. It is important to note that these computed etch rates do not take into account kinetic effects that would be included in experimental etch rates. Therefore, we also compute the maximum etch rate for the removal of a complete monolayer of material from  $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO}_2$  .We used 16 metal atoms for one ML removal, which requires a  $\\mathrm{Hf - F / Zr - F}$  coverage of  $32.32\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{F / nm}^2$  An etch rate of  $- 2.82\\pm 0.02\\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$  was computed for one ML removal using the same method for calculating the theoretical etch rate.

The first thing we observe is that for a specific reactant combination, the etch rate increases with temperature for both materials and the etch rate for  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  is larger than that of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ . We have predicted this from  $\\mathrm{N} - \\mathrm{E}$  analysis that the minimum barrier to continuous etching decreases considerably with an increase in temperature, more so in the case of  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  when compared to  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ . Between 150 and  $350^{\\circ}C$ , for different reactant combinations, the etch rates can be anywhere between 0.05 and  $1.24\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and between 0.01 and  $1.59\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ . The computed etch rate prediction given earlier based on the maximal  $\\mathrm{M} - \\mathrm{F}$  coverage  $\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{Hf}, \\mathrm{Zr}$  should be taken carefully as the experimental etch rate varies greatly with temperature and the reactant, in the second pulse. Moreover, the maximal experimental etch rate reported is much larger than the predicted etch rate, suggesting that further reaction of adsorbed HF with the substrate is possible and this reaction surmounts the kinetic barriers, which we have not included in this simple adsorption study. However, comparing the maximal etch rate of  $- 2.82\\pm 0.02\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle for one ML removal of  $\\mathrm{Hf / ZrO_2}$  along with experimental etch rates, we can calculate the number of  $\\mathrm{Hf / Zr}$  removed  $\\mathrm{nm}^2$  in those experiments. Our surface model contains  $8.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{M / nm^2}$ $\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{Hf}, \\mathrm{Zr}$  as mentioned earlier.

At  $T< 500\\mathrm{K}$ , the HF reaction with both oxides is found to be in the preferred self- limiting state. This is a relatively inexpensive way to screen the reactant molecules for ALE, also equally applicable to ALD, of any given substrate. We studied the adsorption of HF molecules on  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  for HF coverages ranging from  $1.0\\pm 0.3$  to  $17.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{HF / nm^2}$  along with analysis of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  formation. From this analysis, we predict a theoretical etch rate based on the maximum possible coverage of surface- bound HF for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ . The maximal computed metal- F coverage on both surfaces is from  $6.0\\pm 0.3$  to  $7.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{metal - F / nm^2}$ . The spontaneous formation of water was also seen at some HF coverages on both oxides. We calculated theoretical etch rates of  $- 0.61\\pm 0.02\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $- 0.57\\pm 0.02\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle for  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ , which are lower than the maximal etch rates reported from experiments. The etch rate for a complete ML removal,  $- 2.82\\pm 0.02\\mathrm{\\AA}$  cycle, was used with experimental etch rates to compute the number of metal atoms removed from the surface per square nanometer per cycle. We can use the presented methodology for the first pulse on  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$  to examine other reagents such as  $\\mathrm{HCl}$  and  $\\mathrm{HBr}$  with a similar analysis as well as examine the interaction of  $\\mathrm{HF}$  on hydroxyl- terminated surfaces of  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ .",
