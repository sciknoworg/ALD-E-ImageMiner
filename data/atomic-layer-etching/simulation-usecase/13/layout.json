For example, the gas must be selected such that spontaneous etching of the solid does not occur in step (1). This is not a severe limitation since, even if spontaneous etching could normally occur, cooling of the substrate at sufficiently low temperature would quench the spontaneous reaction, without affecting the reaction in step (3) [in step (3) energy is supplied by the energetic beam, i.e., this is not a thermally activated process]. Also, the energetic beam must be chosen so that the process is self- limiting, i.e., once surface reaction has been completed in step (3), any further irradiation by the energetic beam should not damage the exposed underlayer. If the above precautions are not taken, etching with monolayer accuracy is not possible."

It is a cyclic process consisting of gas adsorption on the surface (step 1), evacuation of excess gas (step 2), irradiation of the surface by an energetic beam (step 3), and evacuation to remove the reaction product (step 4). Completion of a cycle results in etching of one monolayer of the solid. A molecular dynamics simulation of ALET of silicon with chlorine gas was performed focusing on step 3. For this purpose, a Si(100) surface with an adsorbed monolayer of chlorine was bombarded by "

No weakly bound species were detected after ion bombardment. In addition, surface diffusion is negligible under the conditions of interest. These observations suggest that, in ALET, chemistry happens only during the ps time scale of ion- solid interaction. This is in sharp contrast to ion- assisted etching effected by simultaneous and continuous exposure of the surface to reactive neutral and ion beams. Under these conditions long time- scale (100s of ms) chemistry can readily happen. Because MD can only capture the events occurring on the ps time scale, MD is suitable for the study of ALET."
