        "text": "Thermally activated chemical vapor- phase etching of titanium nitride (TiN) is studied by utilizing either alternate exposures of niobium pentafluoride  $(\\mathrm{NbF}_5)$  and carbon tetrachloride  $(\\mathrm{CCl}_4)$  or by using  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  alone. Nitrogen  $(\\mathrm{N}_2)$  gas purge steps are carried out in between every reactant exposure. Titanium nitride is etched in a non- self- limiting way by  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5\\mathrm{- }\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  based binary chemistry or by  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  at temperatures between 370 and  $460^{\\circ}C$ . Spectroscopic ellipsometry and a weight balance are used to calculate the etch per cycle. For the binary chemistry, an etch per cycle of  $\\approx 0.8\\mathrm{\\AA}$  is obtained for 0.5 and 3 s long exposures of  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  and  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$ , respectively at  $460^{\\circ}C$ . On the contrary, under the same conditions, the etch process with  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  alone gives an etch per cycle of about  $0.5\\mathrm{\\AA}$ . In the  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$ - only etch process, the thickness of TiN films removed at  $460^{\\circ}C$  varies linearly with the number of etch cycles. Furthermore,  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  alone is able to etch TiN selectively over other materials such as  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$ ,  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ , and  $\\mathrm{Si}_3\\mathrm{N}_4$ . X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy and bright field transmission electron microscopy are used for studying the post- etch surfaces. To understand possible reaction products and energetics, first- principles calculations are carried out with density functional theory. From thermochemical analysis of possible reaction models, it is found that  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  alone cannot etch TiN while  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  alone can etch it at high temperatures. The predicted byproducts of the reaction between the  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  gas molecules and TiN surface are  $\\mathrm{TiCl}_3$  and  $\\mathrm{ClCN}$ . Similarly,  $\\mathrm{TiF}_4$ ,  $\\mathrm{NbFCl}_3$ , and  $\\mathrm{ClCN}$  are predicted to be the likely products when TiN is exposed to both  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  and  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$ . A more favorable etch reaction is predicted when TiN is exposed to both  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  and  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  ( $\\Delta G = - 2.7\\mathrm{eV}$  at  $640\\mathrm{K}$ ) as compared to exposure to  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$  only ( $\\Delta G = - 2\\mathrm{eV}$  at  $640\\mathrm{K}$ ) process. This indicates that an enhanced etch rate is possible when TiN is exposed alternately to both  $\\mathrm{NbF}_5$  and  $\\mathrm{CCl}_4$ , which is in close agreement with the experimental results.",

        "text": "Figure 7 plots an XPS depth profile of the elements found in an about  $9 \\text{nm}$  TiN film remaining when the etch process was incomplete. The TiN film was etched by 300 cycles of the  $\\text{NbF}_5\\text{- }\\text{CCl}_4$  etch process at  $460^{\\circ} \\text{C}$ . The total of  $60 \\text{s}$  sputter time is estimated to etch about  $1.8 \\text{nm}$  of the TiN film. From the figure it can be seen that the surface contains about  $26 \\text{at\\%}$  carbon,  $31 \\text{at\\%}$  oxygen,  $20 \\text{at\\%}$  nitrogen,  $15 \\text{at\\%}$  titanium, and about  $5 \\text{at\\%}$  niobium. In addition, small amounts of silicon and fluorine were also detected with both being below  $2 \\text{at\\%}$ . The silicon signal is from the  $\\text{SiO}_2$  film underneath the TiN film. After  $15 \\text{s}$  of argon ion sputtering, the carbon signal is dropped to about  $4 \\text{at\\%}$  and goes further down to  $3 \\text{at\\%}$  after  $1 \\text{min}$  of sputtering. The atomic percentages for titanium, nitrogen, and oxygen are observed around 24, 32, and 28 respectively after sputtering the surface for  $15 \\text{s}$ . A fairly high niobium amount from 5 to  $6 \\text{at\\%}$  along with fluorine of about  $0.9 - 1.7 \\text{at\\%}$  may indicate that the  $\\text{NbF}_5$  is capable of either reacting or dissociating on TiN or the TiN surface modified by  $\\text{CCl}_4$ . The presence of niobium is evidently consistent with the DFT adsorption studies discussed in Section S1, Supporting Information. After sputtering for a minute, the presence of significant amounts of niobium, fluorine and carbon inside the top layer of the TiN films may be attributed to various reasons such as surface diffusion of the elements at etch temperatures preferentially through TiN grain boundaries, or increased surface area due to preferential etching along grain boundaries. They can also result from energetic argon ions bombarding the atoms deeper into the film. The absence of chlorine on or in the post- etch TiN layer points toward the formation of volatile products containing chlorine such as  $\\text{TiCl}_3$ ,  $\\text{TiCl}_4$ ,  $\\text{NbFCl}_3$ ,  $\\text{NbClF}_4$ , and  $\\text{ClCN}$ . All these compounds are predicted by the DFT simulation results.",

For a reference, schematic 1 provides an idea of such a 3D structure where the blue horizontal fins are  $\\text{SiO}_2$  fins and the black back- bone is silicon. This 3D structure was coated by a thin ALD TiN film[35] with extremely high confor- . mality. One big advantage of gas- phase chemical etching over plasma- based etching is its capability to etch material from non- line- of- sight features of this sort. Another advantage can be maintaining conformality during the etching or thinning of the films. However, the non- self- limiting gas- phase chemical etching reactions can also affect the conformality. In order to improve the etch conformality, another etchant or controlreactant can be introduced to either improve conformality or modify the etch rate such that etching from non- line- of- sight features may follow more uniform removal.",
