Experiments may be conducted to investigate chamber configuration designs and optimal operating conditions; however, they can be costly and time consuming. Therefore, this work develops a multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling framework to simulate thermal ALE of aluminum oxide thin films. First, a CFD reactor model for four different reactor designs (typical, multi- inlet, showerhead, and inclined plate) is constructed through Ansys software. Next, the macroscopic CFD model is combined with a previously developed microscopic model of the etching process, which is based on a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to describe the features of the atomistic etching processes occurring on the film. The multiscale CFD model is used to determine the best reactor configuration for achieving film etching uniformity while minimizing process operating time resulting in a reduction of reagent consumption."

In line with this demand, extensive research for optimizing semiconductor manufacturing processes has been conducted recently. Fin field- effect transistors (FinFETs), as types of modern nanoelectronic semiconductors, were developed as a consequence to this increasing demand. FinFETs have facilitated the process of engraving three- dimensional (3D) circuit patterns on the substrate with a high aspect ratio, leading to higher computing speed with lower current leakage (Jurczak et al., 2009). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has greatly contributed to the development of FinFET technology. ALD is a thin film deposition process in which a wafer is exposed to two precursor pulses in a sequential manner. Each precursor reacts with the surface species separately to avoid undesired reactions, known as self- limiting behavior, resulting in the production of high- quality thin films. As a result, ALD has led to the reduction in the size of FinFETs, which has "

GAA transistors use vertically stacked nanosheets or nanowires instead of fins in FinFETs so nanosheets are covered on all sides by the gate. The GAA technology has been predicted to reach an era of sub- 5 nm thickness. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to commercialize GAA technology. In addition to ALD, atomic layer etching (ALE), as a counter part of ALD, has emerged as an essential process for GAA- based nanochip production. ALE is an etching process in which the substrate is exposed to sequential precursor pulses to remove a monolayer of the substrate in each etching cycle. ALE is a relatively new technique, and therefore, it has not been fully investigated in both empirical and computational ways. In order to completely understand the ALE process and make it possible to optimize the process configuration design, it is essential to fully develop a multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for ALE processes."

An area- selective deposition process from a CFD point of view has been studied (De la Huerta et al., 2018). Crose et al. (2018) and Zhang et al. (2020) performed multiscale CFD simulations for plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), respectively. Their research, however, is limited to simulations for understanding atomic layer processes but not for reactor design and optimization. Zhang et al.

Next, a 3D CFD macroscopic model using Ansys Fluent 2021R2, as a commercial CFD software, is established for the gas- phase domain in which mass, momentum, and energy transport are considered. Lastly, the microscopic and the macroscopic models are combined to fully characterize the thermal atomic layer etching of aluminum oxide thin films and used to evaluate four reactor chamber designs."

Meanwhile, 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling based on the principles of fluid dynamics and transport phenomena allows one to obtain engineering data without any physical experiments for a considerably inexpensive cost. Moreover, the CFD simulation can be performed at various operating conditions, enabling one to ascertain an empirical model with a greater collection of data. It is, however, limited to provide the atomistic reaction information from a microscopic point of view even if macroscopic CFD modeling offers extensive data in terms of mass, momentum, and energy transport. To overcome this issue in this work, a 3D multiscale CFD model is built by combining a macroscopic CFD model with a previously developed microscopic model (Yun et al., 2022) of the etching process based on a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) algorithm, thus resulting in providing a comprehensive understanding for the thermal ALE process of aluminum oxide thin films. Zhang et al. (2020) and Yun et al. (2021) have important and timely articles on multiscale CFD modeling for plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). The authors provided valuable insight of the PEALD process of hafnium oxide thin films and used these models to study real- time control. Despite their efforts, their multiscale CFD modeling lacked a degree of accuracy since they did not consider the consumption of reactants and the production of products, which would affect the pressure distribution of the system. To address this issue, in this work, the heterogeneous surface reactions in the 3D CFD model are established in accordance with the reaction mechanisms of the microscopic model so that the etching of the surface species on the substrate can be simulated. Those reactions clearly have an impact on the momentum, energy, and mass transport in the gas- phase domain, in which the two precursors are consumed and the products of water and dimethylaluminum fluoride are yielded and transported from the substrate to the gas- phase domain. Pressure and temperature at different locations on the substrate are calculated at every time step and transferred to the microscopic model to calculate the etching progression in an"

Pressure and temperature data at the twelve wafer regions are extracted from the CFD model at each time step and substituted into the kMC algorithm. All reaction rate constants are obtained from temperature and pressure by using Collision Theory and Transition- State Theory. Finally, the sum of the rate "

                                    "content": "For macroscopic modeling, four different types of reactors are constructed and their performances are evaluated with respect to two metrics: film uniformity and etching speed (the specific designs considered are discussed in greater detail in the next subsection). The performance of a reactor is closely related to how fast a film on the wafer is deposited or etched. The magnitude of the deposition and etching rates is largely dependent on the type of fluid flow (laminar or turbulent), which is directly related to the precursor flow rates. For instance, Peltonen et al. (2018) demonstrated that higher precursor flow rates resulted in higher deposition and etching rates, but the reduction in their process operating times was not significant. In addition to the deposition/etching rate, the film etching uniformity across the wafer is another key factor to evaluate the reactor designs. Despite the fact that self- limiting behaviors have been reported in atomic layer processes (Lill, 2021), the spatial film etching uniformity could be degraded due to the non- uniform distribution of precursors (Elers et al., 2006) in the gas- phase above the wafer, and this could compromise the integrity of the etched product. For instance, turbulent flow can disrupt the uniformity of the fluid flow, thus undermining the film quality of the wafer. For this research, it is desirable to consider several reactor configurations that can introduce inherent reactor resistance to turbulent flow and maintain a laminar flow profile for the operating flow rate regime to improve film etching quality. Therefore, these two aforementioned factors, etching rate and uniformity, are considered to compare the performances of the four reactor configurations considered in this work."

The top injection reactor with distributors enables precursors to be uniformly injected above the wafer leading to highly uniform etching of the thin films. On the other hand, the cross- flow reactor has a smaller height of a few mm so that the gas displacement time is minimized. The cross- flow model also maximizes the lateral convective flow across the wafer. In this work, the cross- flow reactor is adopted to reduce the process and purge time since HF has a long residence time, which may remove self- limiting behavior resulting in spontaneous chemical vapor etching (Lee and George, 2015). These cross- flow reactors are "

However, for conformal thin film etching, it is essential to obtain uniform flow profiles across the surface of the wafer (Elers et al., 2006). Therefore, different distributors are employed in the cross- flow reactors to optimize the flow profiles of the precursor. Then, the modified reactors are compared to the simplest reactor geometry that has no distributor to determine if the distributor is effective in improving the performance of the precursor flow uniformity and the etching rate."

A uniform aspect ratio is desirable for regions where the flow field varies greatly and an ideal aspect ratio is equivalent to unity for equilateral cells. Lastly, the resolution has a significant contribution to how critical regions are calculated and directly affects the total number of cells used to describe the mesh. The resolution of the mesh is a measure of the distribution of cells in particular regions of the mesh geometry and is measured in terms of coarseness or fineness. Meshing mode contains a tool that produces adaptive sizing that automatically generates regions where the mesh is finer at the boundary regions and coarser in regions away from the boundary. It is important to obtain high resolution, especially in critical regions where boundary layers change dramatically in their behavior, specifically, wall- fluid boundaries, which will affect the accuracy of the computed numerical solution. Thus, the following equation, which is derived from the Blasius approximate solution for laminar flow over a flat plate, can be employed for determining the meshing in the flow domain near the walls:"

The results from the meshing process for all reactor configurations, which are listed in Table 1, indicate that all reactor geometries are within the acceptability criteria for the average values. This also implies that the meshes built via Fluent's Meshing Mode would have reliable computed results. Mesh independence studies were also carried out for all reactor designs to ensure that the simulation results are independent of the mesh structure."

However, some species produced during the etching process have limited thermophysical data in the open literature. One of these species, dimethylaluminum fluoride (DMAF), has little to no available experimental data, thus computational chemistry calculations via the open- source thermochemistry simulation software, Quantum Espresso (QE), are utilized to calculate thermophysical parameters including the standard enthalpy, the standard entropy, and the specific heat (Giannozzi, 2009; Baroni et al., 2011) for DMAF. Despite the accessibility of QE, there are limitations for calculating other thermophysical parameters including thermal conductivity and viscosity. For this work, these parameters are determined by adopting the parameters from a chemically similar molecule, dimethylaluminum chloride (DMACI),"

First, the PWscf (Plane- Wave self- consistent field) program is used to calculate the electronic properties and optimize the atomic positions of the molecule, which are modeled using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and PAw (Projector Augmented Wave) pseudopotential data. Next, the PHonon package is used to calculate the dynamical matrix of the phonons. Various programs are dedicated to the building of the dynamical matrix (PH program), to the solving of the interatomic force constants (IFC) from the dynamical matrix (Q2R program), and to calculating the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix, which are the vibrational frequencies of the molecule (MATDYN program), by employing the finite displacement method and the density functional perturbation theory."

There are two solver technologies available in Fluent: pressure- based and density- based. The pressure- based solver has been traditionally used for incompressible and mildly compressible flow. The thermal ALE is operated at an extremely low pressure in a single- phase flow, and thus, the pressure change of the mixture is negligible. In addition, the feed composition of the precursor is low, therefore the density and pressure change of the species are negligible for this simulation. Therefore, the pressure- based solver is applicable for this work. The operating conditions of the reactor are listed in Table 3. In addition, under the pressure- based solver, the coupled algorithm is used to significantly decrease the convergence time, in which the momentum equation and the pressure- based continuity equation are solved simultaneously. Transient analysis for comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of thermal ALE is performed with a time step of "

The assumption is validated by the contours of the Reynolds number at 0.025 s of half- cycle time elapsed at standard reactor operating conditions, which are illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. It is observed that the highest Reynolds number is localized at the precursor injection region for Steps A and B, with the largest Reynolds number among all reactor configurations being 1.30 for Step A and 2.59 for Step B with both values obtained from the showerhead reactor. Consequently, no turbulent regime is observed throughout all of the reactors due to the atmospheric operating condition which provides more control over the flow pattern. As a result, the flow through the reactor is characterized by laminar behavior and supports the assumption made in Section 2.3.1."

Dividing the wafer into twelve sections enables one to collect more accurate and plausible numerical solutions than simulations with averaged pressure and temperature for the whole wafer. The results of multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for the reactors are provided in Table 4. For all four reactors, the half- cycle times for Step A are calculated as 1.414 s through 1.446 s and the half- cycle times for Step B are also calculated as 2.498 s through 2.542 s using the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method. The half- cycle times for both steps were computationally determined to be 1.38 s and 2.38 s, respectively, in the previously developed microscopic model (Yun et al., 2022) where the simulations were performed under ideal conditions without the influence of transport phenomena effects in the gas phase, which was supported by the experimental data from Lee et al. (2016). It is obvious that the half- cycle times from the multiscale CFD modeling are delayed due to the inclusion of mass transport as it takes some time for the wafer to be saturated by the precursors unlike the microscopic model at the steady- state. Furthermore, the consideration of the consumption of precursor species contributes to the slower process time. Hence, it is demonstrated that the overall multiscale CFD modeling including the thermophysical data is successfully developed."

In the initial stages of flow development, the parabolic pressure profile mentioned in the discussion of G0 is also displayed with that of G2 in Figs. 8c and 9c. It is observed that the showerhead serves to decrease the amount of precursor in central regions of the wafer, and therefore G2 has better uniformity compared to G0 and G1. The half- cycle times (1.436 s for Step A and 2.528 s for Step B) are similar to the half- cycle times of G0 due to the flow resistance of the showerhead divider. Thus, the addition of the showerhead divider improves the uniformity, but marginally improves the half- cycle time for Step A and slightly increases the half- cycle time for Step B."

The comparison of the half- cycle times of Steps A and B and the annual feed consumption of the precursor species, HF and TMA, are displayed in Fig. 11. The annual feed consumption is calculated by assuming that 96 cycles of etching are conducted daily and that the half- cycle times for each feed flow rate remain constant with each cycle in a single wafer system. The estimates for the precursor consumption are calculated for a single wafer. The results for Step A in Fig. 11a indicate that the half- cycle time for Step A for G3 is consistently faster compared to that of G0, "

Consequently, the benefits of utilizing the inclined plate reactor not only include reduced modification (Fluorination) and etching times but also a lesser amount of precursors is needed when compared to the typical reactor. Despite being able to maximize the amount of precursor saved for the 600 sccm flow rate, the reduction in the half- cycle times for Steps A and B suggest that increasing the precursor flow rate does not reduce the half- cycle times significantly, and thus, it may be preferable to operate under laminar- like conditions with a lower magnitude of flow rate as discussed by Peltonen et al.

The CFD simulation was performed first by constructing various reactor geometries (typical, multi- inlet, showerhead, and inclined plate) and meshing these geometries was completed until the quality criteria were met using Ansys software. Next, Ansys Fluent was used to perform the CFD simulation with the inclusion of precursor consumption via reactions corresponding to the microscopic model of the etching process. The phonon calculations to obtain thermophysical data were carried out prior to CFD calculations with some materials requiring the use of computational chemistry software, Quantum Espresso (QE), to calculate the thermophysical data through electronic calculations. Lastly, the process data exported at every time step from Fluent were used in the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) microscopic model to determine the half- cycle times for Steps A and B for each reactor geometry. The results of the multiscale CFD model were validated by the experimental results from Lee and George (2015). It was found that the inclined plate reactor produces a desirable distribution of precursor to the wafer and has"
