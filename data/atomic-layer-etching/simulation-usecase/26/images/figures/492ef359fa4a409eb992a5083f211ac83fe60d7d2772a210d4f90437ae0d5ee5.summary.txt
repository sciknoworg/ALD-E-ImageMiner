The chart illustrates the relationship between energy (in eV) and the thickness of the damaged layer (in nm) for thin and thick Cl layer depositions. The thin Cl layer deposition shows a more gradual increase in damaged layer thickness compared to the thick Cl layer deposition, which exhibits a steeper initial increase followed by a plateau.
