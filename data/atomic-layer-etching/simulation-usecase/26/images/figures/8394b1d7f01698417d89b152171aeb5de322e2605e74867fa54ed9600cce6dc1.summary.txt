The diagram illustrates the adsorption and desorption steps involving ions and radicals interacting with a silicon surface. In the adsorption step, ions and radicals attach to the Si surface, creating a layer. During the desorption step, Ar+ ions influence the surface, leading to the detachment of some ions.
