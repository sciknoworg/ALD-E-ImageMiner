        "text": "As semiconductor device structures continue to approach the nanometer size range, new challenges in the fabrication of such devices have arisen. For example, the need for high- aspect- ratio, highly selective, controllable, and isotropic or anisotropic etching at the nanometer scale are some of them. Recently, atomic layer etching (ALE) has attracted much attention as an alternative to the conventional reactive ion etching (RIE) to address these issues. In comparison with RIE, ALE offers highly uniform etching over a large area with a precise etched depth and little damage to the underlying material surface. However, the extent of the surface damage formation in ALE processes has not been extensively reported yet. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation is used to examine the surface damages and reaction mechanisms during plasma- assisted (PA- ) ALE of silicon (Si) with chlorine (Cl) radical adsorption and low- energy  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion irradiation for desorption. Several ALE cycles have been simulated and reproducible etched depths per cycle have been obtained. Based on the depth profiles, a damaged surface layer with a thickness of about  $1.5\\mathrm{nm}$  is found to be caused by the ALE process even at a very low ion incident energy of  $20\\mathrm{eV}$  in the simulation. The thickness of a damaged- layer on the etched surface slightly increases with the ion incident energy for the energy range examined in this study  $(20 - 60\\mathrm{eV})$ , and Cl atoms deposited on the surface in the ALE adsorption step are transported deeper in the damaged- layer by the ion bombardment. Our simulation results indicate that a certain damage formation cannot be avoided on the \"as- etched\" surface of a PA- ALE process and, if the damaged- layer inadvertently affects the device performance, further action to mitigate the damage needs to be taken.",

        "text": "The goal of this study is to understand the damage formation by low- energy ion bombardment used in silicon (Si) plasma- assisted ALE (PA- ALE) based on chlorine (Cl) adsorption. Figure 1 shows a schematic process flow of such an ALE process. In the adsorption step, a Si surface is exposed to a Cl- containing plasma or  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  gas and its surface is chlorinated. This is to activate the surface by weakening the binding energies of surface atoms. If a Cl- containing plasma is used without bias voltage in this step, the surface is chlorinated by Cl radicals as well as  $\\mathrm{Cl}^+$  ions in- evident upon the surface at the plasma potential energy. If a  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  gas is used,  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules are dissociated at the Si surface and only the top layer gets chlorinated. Under the ideal conditions, no etching occurs in the adsorption step. In the desorption step, the surface is irradiated with low- energy  $\\mathrm{Ar}^+$  ions and the Cl modified surface may be removed by the impact. Because our aim is to remove the Cl modified surface layer only, the incident  $\\mathrm{Ar}^+$  ions should not be energetic enough to etch a bare Si surface. Once the Cl modified surface is depleted, the etching is expected to stop. This defines the self- limit feature of ALE. These two steps form a single cycle of ALE, which is repeated a number of times until the desired etching depth is achieved.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations41- 43 were also used to study such systems and their results44- 48 are in good agreement with the experimental observations in general. Therefore, the basic nature of the desorption step of Si PA- ALE by Cl adsorption has been reasonably well understood. What we attempt to clarify in this study is how the etched surface of the preceding cycles affects the outcome of the following ALE cycles, depending on the ion incident energy. To achieve this goal, we also use MD simulation in this study.",

Thus, the measured etch per cycle (EPC), i.e., the averaged etched depth in a single ALE cycle, was small. A more recent study by Tan et al.57 used a Cl plasma in the adsorption step, which led to the formation of a relatively thick Cl- Si mixed layer on the surface and exhibited a higher EPC. MD simulations45,58 and simulations based on other models59- 63 were also used to study PA- ALE of Si by Cl adsorption. Athvale and Economou58 first performed an MD simulation of an ALE process. They briefly discussed the surface damage of Si PA- ALE but focused only on the first cycle. Kubota et al.45 examined the reaction pathways of the desorbed species. A recent study by Huard et al.61 used a hybrid plasma equipment model to study the factors affecting ideal ALE processes. Sherpa et al.62 examined a Cl adsorption step by ab initio MD simulation.

In the opposite case, either no etching occurs or etching takes place too slowly to deplete the deposited Cl atoms and does not exhibit a self- limiting etch stop during the desorption step. In general, a sufficient amount of Cl needs to be adsorbed or deposited in the adsorption step to have a sufficiently high chemical etch rate compared with the physical sputtering rate of pristine Si at the given  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion energy.",

        "text": "As seen in Fig. 5, in our MD simulation, we did not observe an ALE window, which has been reported in earlier experimental studies54- 57 under various conditions. It is not clear why we did not observe it even with a sufficiently long desorption time. Indeed, above  $40\\mathrm{eV}$  the major part of the EPC shown in Fig. 5 is due to physical sputtering in this figure. (In the thin Cl layer deposition case, EPC is nearly entirely due to physical sputtering at or above  $40\\mathrm{eV}$  Our simulations have shown that a chlorinated Si layer has a higher etch rate than the physical sputtering rate of pristine Si but the chemical etch rate also depends on the  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion energy. Such a difference in the etch rate of chlorinated Si is reflected in the difference in EPC between 20 and  $30\\mathrm{eV}$  of Fig. 5. Another possible reason is the lack of thermal desorption of Si in our MD simulation. As discussed earlier, our MD simulation quenches the system soon after the sputtering or emission of surface atoms occurs by a single ion impact, which prevents slow thermal desorption of surface atoms and moieties. At low ion incident energy, where the etch rate due to the direct  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion impact is sufficiently low, the contribution from thermal processes may not be negligible. Detailed discussion on the lack of ALE windows in our simulation is the subject of a future study.",

        "text": "The damaged- layer thickness, i.e., the thickness of a subsurface region where recoiled Cl (and possibly Ar) atoms remain after the ALE, is plotted in Fig. 7. Under the conditions that we examined, the damaged- layer thickness was higher than  $1.5\\mathrm{nm}$  and a weakly increasing function of the ion energy. The difference in the damaged- layer thicknesses between the thin and thick Cl layer deposition cases was not particularly large. As shown in Fig. 6, the density of Cl atoms in the damaged- layer is about  $0.5\\times 10^{22}\\mathrm{cm}^{- 3}$  Because the damaged- layer thickness is significantly larger than the EPC at low ion incident energy and at best comparable with the EPC at relatively high ion energy, the formation of a damaged- layer whose thickness is not negligible compared with the EPC is unavoidable for all the energy range examined here. Depending on the device structures to which such ALE processes are applied, the damage formation may affect device performance.",
