| Energy (eV) | Description |
|---|---|
| 5 eV | A 3D scatter plot showing particles at 5 eV energy level, with a dense cluster near the bottom and some scattered particles above.
| 10 eV | Similar to 5 eV, but with slightly more dispersed particles.
| 25 eV | Particles become more spread out compared to lower energies, indicating increased kinetic energy.
| 50 eV | The most dispersed pattern, with particles far from the bottom layer, suggesting high energy impact.
