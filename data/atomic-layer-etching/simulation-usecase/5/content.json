        "text": "With the decrease of electronic device size from the micro, via the nano, down to the atomic scale, the variability of the surface patterning needs to be controlled within dozens of atoms accordingly.1,2 Plasma etching is an essential surface patterning technique. Conventionally, it is realized by ionizing non- reactive species such as Ar to transfer energy to the surface, and at the same time another reactive species such as  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  etches the surface either in its neutral or ionized state.3- 6 However, mixing of energetic and reactive flows leads to coupling of their transport, which increases complexity and makes it hard to achieve highly defined low feature sizes. Moreover, this mixing can lead to the damage of the etching front, as high energy ions distort the surface structure and open a way for reactive species to penetrate deep into the substrate  $(>20~\\mathrm{nm})$  . Thus, new methods are needed to meet the requirement of precise etching control at the atomic scale, and atomic layer etching (ALE) has been proposed as one solution.1,2,7,8 The basic idea is to separate the energetic and reactive flows to avoid the above problems. It removes thin layers of material based on a two- step self- limiting reaction: surface modification and removal. Surface modification makes a surface layer within a well- defined range more easily to be etched afterwards; for example, one can use halogen gas adsorption on the semiconductor surface to weaken the bonds; in the removal step, plasma ions are controlled within a certain Shenli Zhang, Yihan Huang, Gulcin Tetiker, Saravanapriyan Sriraman, Alex Paterson and Roland Faller  $\\oplus$  \\*c",

Silicon and GaAs have been the most studied ALE materials since.1 Germanium is another interesting material as a candidate to replace Si for application as transistor channels due to its superior hole mobility. Several papers have been studied ALE of Ge experimentally,3,11,1 but the microscopic understanding of the influence of the process variables on etching is still missing. Such a study is crucial to determine appropriate conditions for ALE to achieve optimal accuracy and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we report our results of an ALE simulation using molecular dynamics on a Ge surface. The surface modification step involves chlorine adsorption (chlorination) of the Ge(100) surface. Chlorine has been found to be non- reactive with Ge below  $350^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C},$  and thus is suitable to be used for a self- limiting reaction at room temperature. Removal is then achieved by  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  bombardment. In our simulation, neutral Ar is used instead of its charged state as the ion will become neutral when approaching the surface.12",

Dimers were found to form, consistent to both DFT and experimental results (see ESI,† Section S2 for details).  $800~\\mathrm{Cl}$  atoms were then introduced with a flux normally incident onto the surface with a defined kinetic energy. One Cl atom at a time was introduced to the simulation box every  $0.1$  ps and the system was then equilibrated for  $2\\mathrm{ns}$ . Single Cl atoms instead of  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules were used to shorten the equilibration time for the adsorption process, as with  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  it also involves the Cl- Cl bond breaking step when it is adsorbed. Charged Cl species were not considered similar to the reason that Ar was used instead of  $\\mathrm{Ar}^+$ . Four different chlorination energies were tested:  $5\\mathrm{eV}$ ,  $10\\mathrm{eV}$ ,  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $50\\mathrm{eV}$ , and simulation was repeated with different initial Cl positions to generate three chlorinated configurations for each condition. Non- adsorbed Cl atoms or  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  molecules ( $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  can be formed from two Cl atoms) were removed from the simulation cell. The adsorption criteria are based on the Ge- Cl bond length  $2.53\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , which means a Cl atom is considered non- adsorbed if it is more than  $2.53\\mathrm{\\AA}$  away from a surface Ge atom. Only chemisorption is considered. Chlorinated configurations were then subjected to Ar bombardment with energies varying from  $20\\mathrm{eV}$  to  $100\\mathrm{eV}$ . The interaction between Ar and  $\\mathrm{Ge / Cl}$  is described by Ziegler- Biersack- Littmark (ZBL) potential, which describes high- energy collisions between atoms. The Ge slab was coupled to a room- temperature thermostat. During a bombardment cycle, one Ar atom is introduced towards the surface and stays in the simulation box for  $1.5\\mathrm{ps}$ . Then the Ar atom is deleted and the system equilibrates for  $0.5\\mathrm{ps}$ . Etched products were then deleted before the start of a new bombardment cycle. Two hundred bombardment cycles were performed for each test condition, and each condition was repeated three times with different chlorinated configurations. The determination of etching products is again based on bond distance  $r_{ij}$ . If  $r_{ij}< R_{ij}$  (1) (which is the inner cutoff distance for the  $i,j$  interaction in Tersoff potential), then atoms  $i$  and  $j$  are considered to be in the same cluster.",

The adsorbed/absorbed Cl number increases from  $320\\pm 5$  atoms  $(5\\mathrm{eV})$  to  $616\\pm 4$  atoms  $(50\\mathrm{eV})$ . Defining Cl penetration depth as the full width at half maximum of Cl density peak, Fig. 2b demonstrates that the penetration depth increases with Cl incident energy. Notice the coverage on surface already reaches  $100\\%$  at  $5\\mathrm{eV}$  (coverage is defined as the Cl- bonded Ge numbers to the number of top layer Ge). From Ge- Cl coordination number (CN) characterization (Table 3), most Ge are bonded to one Cl, however increasing chlorination energy will increase the bonded Cl number (from the increase of the average CN). Also, more Ge will bond with Cl (from the increase of the coverage). The high population of Ge- 1Cl bonding is because the energy decrease from Ge- Ge to Ge- 1Cl is much larger than that from Ge- 1Cl to Ge- nCl. It is worth noting that the result could be sensitive to force field training, if the bond energy change from GeCl to  $\\mathrm{GeCl_2}$  is larger than Ge- Ge to Ge- 1Cl, then Ge- 2Cl can be a more favorable configuration. The decrease of energy with Cl penetration can be also seen in the system energy (Fig. 2b). The system energy is defined as the total energy divided by the number of atoms in the system. It decreases with chlorination energy, or Cl numbers, as bonding between Ge and Cl is stronger than that among Ge. The Ge surface structure becomes highly distorted with increasing chlorination energy, as the radial distribution function in Fig. 2c shows the eventual formation of amorphous structures at  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $50\\mathrm{eV}$ . It is also seen that the Ge- Ge bond length increases from  $2.8\\mathrm{\\AA}$  (in the perfect crystal) to  $3.2\\mathrm{\\AA}$  due to Cl penetration, as the first peak in RDF shifted towards longer bond distance with increasing energy.",

This distribution follows the Ge- Cl CN trend in the chlorination step, as Ge- 1Cl has the highest fraction, followed by Ge- 2Cl and Ge- 3Cl. It's likely the chlorination morphology determines the etching product. Besides, for surface with low chlorination energy such as the  $5\\mathrm{eV}$  case (Fig.4c), both Ge and Cl etched number decrease greatly after about hundred bombardment cycle, as the surface becomes deficient in Cl. This indicates two things: first, chlorination is necessary to weaken Ge- Ge bond strength and makes etching possible; second, amorphization of top Ge surface layers also weakens Ge- Ge bond strength such that physical sputtering is only possible within modified layers. With higher chlorination energy, the self- terminated etching process could require more Ar bombardment cycles.",

        "text": "By varying the Ar bombardment energy from  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  to  $100\\mathrm{eV}$  we see that the chlorination energy influences the threshold energy for etching. The density profile (Fig. 5a) indicates whether etching occurs. Fig. 5a shows the evolution of element density profile of  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  chlorinated surface under different bombardment condition (see ESI,  $\\dagger$  Fig. S9- S11 for other chlorinated conditions). At  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  Ar energy, Cl density peak already starts to decrease, and Ge surface recedes towards the bulk phase. With  $50\\mathrm{eV}$  Ar, the etching effect is more obvious, and most Cl has been etched away when Ar energy reaches  $75\\mathrm{eV}$ . Thus, the threshold energy should be below  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  Ar, matching well with the experimental operation window. Similarly, the  $5\\mathrm{eV}$  chlorinated surface has a threshold energy between  $50 - 55\\mathrm{eV}$ . For the  $10\\mathrm{eV}$  chlorinated case, this threshold energy slightly decreases to  $25 - 50\\mathrm{eV}$ , and for  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  and  $50\\mathrm{eV}$  chlorinated surface, etching starts below  $25\\mathrm{eV}$ . Thus, a higher chlorination energy generally decreases the threshold energy for bombardment, possibly because the highly disordered surface structure makes it more vulnerable for detachment.",

Besides, both chlorination energy and bombardment energy have an impact on the etching efficiency. Fig. 5b shows the change of the total etched number of Ge and Cl atoms with Ar energy for each chlorinated condition. Several things can be noticed here. First, both Ge and Cl etching increases with Ar energy. Since the etching time and bombardment flux is fixed,",

Both etched Cl and Ge number in  $5\\mathrm{eV}$  chlorinated case tend to reach a plateau with increasing Ar energy, due to the limited Cl number and modification layer in the system (self- limited etching process), which further proves the bond weakening by chlorination. Higher chlorination energy such as  $50\\mathrm{eV}$  postpones the appearance of the plateau, as more Cl are originally in the system. If the Ar energy is further increased beyond the plateau, the etched Ge number should increase quickly again due to pure physical sputtering. This naturally leads to the third conclusion that this limit of chemically etched number depends on chlorination energy, or the number of Cl available in the system.",

        "text": "In conclusion, we used molecular dynamics with a newly improved and validated Ge- Cl Tersoff potential to understand the influence of operation energy on each stage in ALE of Ge and their synergy effect. The chlorination energy is the key factor in surface modification step. Increasing chlorination energy increases Cl adsorption and its penetration depth. It also increases Ge- Cl coordination number from Ge- 1Cl to Ge- 2Cl and turns the surface into amorphous layer after  $25\\mathrm{eV}$ . The configuration and composition of modified surface then dominates the etching results in Ar bombardment step. First, GeCl is the main chemical etching product in our case, as Ge- 1Cl is also the main CN during chlorination. Second, the chlorination quantity determines the limit of chemically etched number in bombardment stage. This reflects the self- limiting characteristic in ALE, as the etching termination point is based on the number of Ge- Ge bonds that have been weakened. The more Cl atoms are bonded in the system, the more etched atoms leave. Third, the extent of chlorination determines the threshold for etching. Highly chlorinated surfaces lead to a lower threshold energy, and at the same time a higher energy or more Ar bombardment cycles for complete etching. The lowest threshold energy is below  $25\\mathrm{eV}$  for the 25 and  $50\\mathrm{eV}$  chlorinated cases. In terms of the influence of bombardment energy, the effective self- terminated etching would require a specific energy range, higher than the threshold energy but lower than spontaneous physical sputtering. And within this range, the increase of bombardment energy leads to an increase of etching rate.",
