A model is introduced that describes why in the nonsaturation mode etch anisotropies may occur that can lead to unwanted performance variations in high aspect ratio semiconductor devices due to topological constraints imposed on the delivery of reactants and removal of reactant by- products.",

The separation of the etching process into separate self- limiting steps reduces the complexity in reactive ion etching (RIE) that is caused by the simultaneous fluxes of many different types of reactive species. The results are improved uniformity across the wafer, across the features with different critical dimensions, and reduced aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE). In addition, there is higher surface smoothness after the completion of the etch. The first industrial implementation of ALE used ions in the second, so- called removal step. This type of ALE is called directional ALE because ions are accelerated toward the wafer surface, which results in a preferred direction of the etching process allowing the formation of devices from primarily horizontally oriented films.",

The processes are temperature sensitive and typically follow exponential laws with respect to temperature. For thermal etching to occur, all steps must have nonzero rates at a given wafer temperature. Not many vapor- phase reactants meet this requirement for a given set of surface materials and, therefore, relatively few thermal etching processes are known and used in the semiconductor industry. The process window for thermal etching is defined by the area of overlap of the rate curves for adsorption of the vapor molecules and desorption of the reaction products as shown in Fig. 1.5",

At higher temperatures, physisorbed molecules may desorb at the same rate as they adsorb and, hence, may not take the next step to chemisorb. Therefore, initial sticking coefficients or chemisorption rates that decrease as a function of temperature are a fairly common observation.6- 8 Such a behavior is consistent with a precursor- mediated adsorption model.10 Therefore, we represent the chemisorption rate of the etching species as a falling curve in Fig. 1. The desorption rate of the reaction products increases generally with temperature. For thermal etching to occur, chemisorption of the etching species and desorption of the reaction curves must have appreciable rates or probabilities as the same temperature. The region of overlapping rate curves represents the process window of a thermal etch process. Compared to ion driven etching processes, there are only a few thermal etch processes used in the semiconductor industry due to small or absent process windows.",

ALE processes are comprised of two steps with self- limiting reactions. A two- step reaction becomes necessary for those materials that do not form volatile compounds in a single step reaction with gases. For instance, many metals can react with oxidizing gases, but the melting points of the oxides and halides are too high for practical etching applications. In these cases, a second step is needed to remove the oxidized metal. This second step is called the removal step while the initial oxidation is called the modification step. In the case of metal oxides, the modification step involves exchanging oxygen with a halogen. The resulting halide at the surface can then be converted into a volatile product in the removal step. These are just two examples for two- step ALE processes; many others are possible and will be discussed later.",

In these intricate structures, dozens of sequential overhangs and recesses will make the paths of reactants and reaction by- products particularly Knudsen- like. Because of that, accessibility and, thereby, surface concentration in deeper parts of such structures are greatly impeded and etch rates will be reduced as a consequence if process steps must be run in a nonsaturated regime to meet throughput targets. Depth dependence in the etch rate is an undesirable outcome as it introduces unwanted top- to- bottom performance variabilities in devices within one stack. When designing thermal ALE processes, care needs to be taken to dose surfaces deep down in holes or beneath overhangs in shelves at the same level as at the entrance of the structure. This requirement can be achieved by increasing the process time to operate all reactions closer to saturation or by introducing compensation steps in a similar fashion as is used in ALD to obtain conformality in the deposited film thickness.",

This mechanism uses a metal precursor to convert the surface of the original metal oxide to another metal oxide. Examples are the conversion of  $\\mathrm{ZnO}$  to  $\\mathrm{Al}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  using HF and trimethylaluminum (TMA) or  $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$  using the same reactants.40,41 \n(3) Conversion to another metal oxide that etches spontaneously. Another mechanism has been established by conversion of a metal oxide into another metal oxide that etches spontaneously for example via exposure to HF. Johnson and George42 and Fischer et al.43 have reported about this approach for the oxides of tungsten and molybdenum, respectively. \n(4) Oxidation to raise the oxidation state. This approach has been used if a lower oxidation state of a metal is not reactive with a compound that volatilizes it, but the higher oxidation state is. In TiN, for example, the oxidation state of the metal can be increased from  $^{3 + }$  when it is bonded to nitrogen to  $^{4 + }$  via oxidation with ozone to  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  .This mechanism has been reported by Lee and George.12 \n(5) Oxidation, conversion, fluorination, and ligand-exchange. This is an ALE mechanism that is particularly relevant for silicon ALE. Elemental silicas is oxidized either at high temperature with  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  or with  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  Its oxide is then converted into aluminum oxide via TMA and the latter volatilized using ligand-exchange with TMA. This process has been described by Abdulagatov and George.44 \n(6) Oxidation, conversion, and fluorination to volatile fluoride. This class is very similar to 3, except that the conversion to another metal oxide such as  $\\mathrm{B}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  is preceded by a primary oxidation of the metal via  $\\mathrm{O}_3$  or an  $\\mathrm{O}_2$  plasma.42,43 \n(7) Oxidation and ligand volatilization.

This can be important for the implementation of a wider range of precursors for thermal ALE. Some organic molecules undergo catalytic dissociation on metallic surfaces, which are an important class of materials to be etched. An example is the ALE process of Co using  $\\mathrm{Cl}_2$  gas and Hhfac as the organic precursor.",

Future directions will need to address the trade- offs between processing speed and aspect ratio or device topology- induced accessibility constraints for reactants and by- products. These challenges can be overcome through multiple routes. For example, possible solutions include process regimes such as ultrahigh pressure, utilizing a certain degree of plasma assistance at least during the modification step, or by introducing additional process steps that counteract the topology challenges.",
