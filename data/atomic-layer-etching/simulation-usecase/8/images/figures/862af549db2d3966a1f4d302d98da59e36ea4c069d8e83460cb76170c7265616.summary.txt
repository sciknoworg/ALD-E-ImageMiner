The chart illustrates the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) in eV/GaN for various etching methods (HF chemical vapor etching, HF conversion, Al(CH₃)₃ Ligand-exchange, F radical chemical vapor etching, F radical conversion) across different temperatures. The preferred conversion and etching regions are indicated by arrows at 500°C.
