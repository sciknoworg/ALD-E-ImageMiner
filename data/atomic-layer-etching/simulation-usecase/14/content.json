More specifically, each cycle of a PE- ALE process typically consists of adsorption and desorption steps. Some PE- ALE steps have more than two steps in a single cycle, as seen in this article later. In a typical adsorption step, the material surface to be etched is exposed to gas- phase molecules or radicals that modify the material surface. In the desorption step, the modified surface is exposed to low- energy inert- gas ions, and some surface atoms are removed by chemically enhanced sputtering. Ideally, the energy of the incident inert- gas ions should be high enough to etch the modified layer, but low enough to etch the pristine material surface. In this way, once the deposited species introduced in the adsorption are nearly exhausted, the etching stops, and thus a self- limiting desorption of the surface material can be achieved.",

This is because there is a significant amount of C accumulation in the cases of  $\\mathrm{Kr^{+}}$  and  $\\mathrm{Xe^{+}}$  ion irradiations compared with the case of  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion irradiation. Such C accumulation hinders the ion impact on the surface and thus the sputtering yield during the desorption step is reduced. Especially in the PE- ALE with  $\\mathrm{Xe^{+}}$  ion irradiation, a relatively thick fluorocarbon (FC) layer is formed, which can cause an etch stop. In the simulations, we used the same desorption time (or ion dose in the desorption step) for each inert- gas ion species to evaluate the damage formation under the same conditions. Of course, a longer desorption time allows better removal of remaining C atoms (especially in the case of  $\\mathrm{Kr^{+}}$  or  $\\mathrm{Xe^{+}}$  ion irradiation), but the thickness of the damaged layer can be also higher under such conditions due to the extended knock- on collision effects. The comparison of the results with Fig. 4 suggests that more C atoms accumulate over the PE- ALE cycles in the cases of  $\\mathrm{Kr^{+}}$  and  $\\mathrm{Xe^{+}}$  ion irradiations than in the case of  $\\mathrm{Ar^{+}}$  ion irradiation.
