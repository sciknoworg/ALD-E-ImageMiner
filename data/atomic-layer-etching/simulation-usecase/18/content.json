Atomic- level control of material processing is required for the fabrication of thin films of high-  $k$  materials at nanoscale device sizes. Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) of metal oxides, in which up to one monolayer of material can be removed, can be achieved by sequential self- limiting fluorination and ligand- exchange reactions at elevated temperatures. First- principles- based atomic- level simulations using density functional theory can give deep insights into the precursor chemistry and the reactions that drive the etching of metal oxides. A previous study examined the hydrogen fluoride (HF) pulse in the first step in the thermal ALE process of crystalline  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ . This study examines the HF pulse on amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  using first- principles simulations. The Natarajan- Elliott analysis, a thermodynamic methodology, is used to compare reaction models representing the self- limiting and spontaneous etch processes taking place during an ALE pulse. For the HF pulse on amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ , we found that thermodynamic barriers impeding spontaneous etching are present at ALE relevant temperatures. HF adsorption calculations on the amorphous oxide surface are studied to understand the mechanistic details of the HF pulse. An HF molecule adsorbs dissociatively by forming Hf- F and O- H bonds. HF coverages ranging from  $1.1 \\pm 0.3$  to  $18.0 \\pm 0.3 \\mathrm{Hf / nm^2}$  are investigated, and a mixture of molecularly and dissociatively adsorbed HF molecules is present at higher coverages. A theoretical etch rate of  $- 0.82 \\pm 0.02 \\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$  for amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  was calculated using a maximum coverage of  $9.0 \\pm 0.3 \\mathrm{Hf - F / nm^2}$ . This theoretical etch rate is greater than the theoretical etch rate for crystalline  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  that we previously calculated at  $- 0.61 \\pm 0.02 \\mathrm{\\AA / cycle}$ . Undercoordinated atoms and void regions in amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  allow for more binding sites during fluorination, whereas crystalline  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  has a limited number of adsorption sites.",

Thermal ALE is a technique that removes thin layers of material using sequential, self- limiting surface reactions and can be viewed as the reverse of atomic layer deposition (ALD). Thermal ALE is based on surface modification and volatilization reactions, where the modification step alters the surface layer into a nonvolatile later followed by the release of volatile etch products from the surface layer in the second reaction.

From this, it is suggested that the first precursor pulse using HF will produce a stable and non- volatile layer of metal fluorides and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  or  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  as byproducts. The reaction energies for the SL product state models 8O/16F and 10O/20F were similar up to  $400\\mathrm{K}$  due to the small difference in the degree of fluorination between the models. The 16O/32F SL product state model reaction energies were more favorable than the 8O/16F and 10O/20F reactions up to  $1302\\mathrm{K}$ . Compared to our previous study examining the fluorination step of crystalline  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$ , the reaction energies for the 16O/32F product state model were less favorable than the partially fluorinated SL product state models.<sup>43</sup> The greater the degree of fluorination on  $\\mathrm{aHfO_2}$ , the more favorable the reaction energies are, showing  $\\mathrm{aHfO_2}$  favors higher fluorine content SL product states than less fluorinated SL product states, which will promote the self- limiting surface modification step. The replacement of oxygen with fluorine during fluorination may be easier due to the lower density of amorphous materials compared to crystalline materials.<sup>40</sup> The spontaneous etch reaction and the self- limiting reactions mentioned above were considered at a constant reactant (HF) pressure of 0.2 Torr and a by- product pressure of 0.01 Torr. The reactant gas pressure is adjustable in the reactor whereas the product pressure is not an experimentally adjustable parameter.<sup>9</sup> Examining the spontaneous etch reaction and the self- limiting reactions at different reactant pressures at a constant product pressure was beyond the scope of this study. A previous study of the thermal ALE of  $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$  using HF by Natarajan et al. examined the influence of reactant and product pressures on the FEPs of the spontaneous etch and self- limiting reactions that are similar to this study.<sup>9</sup> It was found that the temperature at which the FEPs of the spontaneous etch and self- limiting reactions cross over is constant at  $360\\mathrm{K}$  with respect to an increase in the reactant pressure with a constant product pressure.<sup>9</sup>",

        "text": "IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSIn this paper, we present DFT calculations to understand the nature of the HF pulse on amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  for thermal ALE. A thermodynamic analysis of the self-limiting and spontaneous etch reactions representing the fluorination on amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  allowed us to predict whether the SE or SL reaction is favorable at a given temperature and a given pressure. At temperatures less than  $520\\mathrm{K}$ , the HF reaction is found to be in the preferred self-limiting state. This is a relatively inexpensive way to screen the reactant molecules for ALE of any given substrate. The adsorption of HF molecules on amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  for HF coverages ranging from  $1.1\\pm 0.3$  to  $18.0\\pm 0.3\\mathrm{HF / nm}^2$  along with analysis of  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  formation was studied. From this analysis, we predict a theoretical etch rate based on the maximum possible coverage of surface-bound HF for amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  which was calculated to be  $-0.82\\pm 0.02\\mathrm{\\AA} / \\mathrm{cycle}$ . This computed etch rate for amorphous  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  is greater than the etch rate computed for crystalline  $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$  from our previous study. We can use the presented methodology for the first pulse on crystalline and amorphous metal oxides to examine other reagents such as  $\\mathrm{SF_4}$  and  $\\mathrm{XeF_2}$  with a similar analysis.",
