| (a) | A molecular structure with yellow spheres representing atoms and red spheres representing oxygen atoms. Blue spheres represent hydrogen atoms. |
| (b) | Similar to (a), this shows another molecular structure with the same atom types. |
| (c) | This structure includes green spheres that appear to represent different atoms than those in (a) and (b). |
| (d) | Another variation showing a different arrangement of atoms compared to (a) and (b). |
| (e) | A structure with a different configuration of atoms, possibly indicating a different phase or state. |
| (f) | A final structure with a unique arrangement of atoms, potentially representing a different chemical compound. |
